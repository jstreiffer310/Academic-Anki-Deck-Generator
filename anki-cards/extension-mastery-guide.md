## ðŸ“‹ Search Patterns for Poor Cards

### Use "Anki: Search Notes" with these queries:
- **Source citations**: `"Information from"` or `"According to"`
- **Incomplete answers**: `"..."`  or `"re..."`
- **Vague questions**: `"What is"` 
- **Too long**: `deck:"PSYC 2240" (find long answers manually)`
- **No elaboration**: Look for simple definitions
