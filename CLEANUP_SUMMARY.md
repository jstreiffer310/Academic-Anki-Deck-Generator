## Improvements Made

### 🔧 Enhanced .gitignore
Updated to prevent future clutter:
- Added Python cache patterns (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Added virtual environment patterns (`.venv/`, `venv/`)
- Added processing artifacts (`logs/`, `temp/`, `drafts/`)
- Preserved essential files (CSV decks, documentation, scripts)

### 📁 Directory Structure
Maintained clean, organized structure:
```
courses/COURSE_CODE/
├── config/          # Course-specific settings
├── content/         # Source materials
├── processing/      # Intermediate files (now gitignored)
├── decks/          # Generated decks (final/ preserved)
└── tools/          # Essential course-specific tools only
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **🎯 Reduced Clutter**: Removed 15+ obsolete tools and temporary files
2. **📈 Improved Navigation**: Cleaner directory structure with essential files only
3. **🔄 Better Maintenance**: .gitignore prevents future accumulation of temp files
4. **💡 Clear Purpose**: Each remaining file has a clear, current purpose
5. **📚 Preserved History**: Working tools and examples retained for reference
