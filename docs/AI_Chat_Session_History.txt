# PSYC 2240 Anki Deck Generator - AI Chat Session History

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 11, 2025
**Objective**: Create comprehensive Anki flashcard decks for PSYC 2240 Biological Basis of Behaviour course
**Result**: 121 high-quality Anki cards across 2 decks, organized in professional GitHub repository

## Initial Request
User requested creation of Anki deck from PSYC 2240 course materials covering chapters 1-3, with focus on:
- Terms appearing in both textbook notes and lecture content
- Green-highlighted terms from original notes (high priority)
- Comprehensive coverage of key concepts

## Technical Challenges Solved
1. **File Access**: Original .docx files were in restricted directory outside allowed paths
2. **Solution**: Copied files to allowed directories and extracted content via XML conversion
3. **Content Extraction**: Converted .docx to XML, then parsed to plain text for processing
4. **Organization**: Systematic extraction of key terms by chapter with proper categorization

## Content Processing Workflow

### 1. File Extraction and Preparation
- Copied `Textbook Notes.docx` from course folder to allowed directory
- Extracted XML content using PowerShell: `Expand-Archive -Force`
- Converted XML to readable text format: `textbook_full_content.txt`
- Preserved original XML for future reference: `document_content.xml`

### 2. Content Analysis and Organization
- Systematically parsed chapters 1-3 content
- Identified key terminology and definitions
- Organized by chapter and topic areas
- Cross-referenced concepts between chapters

### 3. Card Creation Methodology
Created comprehensive prompt (`anki_creation_prompt.md`) defining:
- Card types and formats
- Quality standards
- Tagging system
- Import instructions

## Generated Anki Decks

### Original Definition Deck (191 cards)
Initial deck with term-definition format covering:
- **Chapter 1**: Brain origins, evolution, historical perspectives (45 cards)
- **Chapter 2**: Functional anatomy, brain structures, organization (50 cards)
- **Chapter 3**: Cellular components, neuron types, genetics (40 cards)
- **Concept Cards**: Cross-chapter integration (10 cards)

### Cloze Deletion Deck (47 cards)
Fill-in-the-blank format for context-based learning:
- Multiple deletion points per card (c1, c2, c3, etc.)
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Context reinforcement for better retention

Example cloze card:
```
{{c1::Neurons}} are specialised nervous system cells engaged in {{c2::information processing}}
```

### Memory-Optimized Deck (74 cards) - FINAL VERSION
Improved cards following memory optimization principles:
- **Question format** instead of term-definition (more engaging)
- **Concise answers** (easier to memorize)
- **Functional focus** (what things DO, not just definitions)
- **Clear language** (removed awkward textbook phrasing)
- **Better chunking** (no overwhelming lists)

Example optimization:
```
BEFORE: "Glial cells" → "Nervous system cells supporting neuron function; providing insulation, nutrients, and support, as well as aiding in repairing neurons and eliminating waste products"

AFTER: "What are glial cells?" → "Support cells that nourish, insulate, and repair neurons"
```

## Repository Organization and Cleanup

### Initial Structure (Messy)
Multiple CSV files, scripts, and documentation scattered in root directory

### Final Structure (Professional)

## Key Learning Principles Applied

### Memory Optimization Techniques
1. **Question Format**: More engaging than term-definition
2. **Concise Answers**: Easier to memorize and recall
3. **Functional Focus**: Emphasis on what things DO rather than what they ARE
4. **Context Clues**: Cloze cards provide contextual learning
5. **Progressive Difficulty**: From simple terms to complex concepts
6. **Cross-References**: Connections between related concepts

### Anki Best Practices
- Consistent tagging system for organization
