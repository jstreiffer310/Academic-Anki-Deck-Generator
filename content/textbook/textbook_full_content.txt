CHAPTER 1 What Are the Origins of Brain and Behavior? Clinical Focus: Living with TBI Traumatic brain injury (TBI): DAMAGE to the brain resulting from a blow to the head Concussion: Damage to the brain caused by a blow to the head 1-1 The Brain in the 21st Century LOQ: Describe the research and societal benefits of the study of brain and behaviour Describe the human brain by identifying some of the defining components and by explaining its relationship to behaviour Why study brain + behaviour? How the brain produces behaviour is a major scientific question The brain is the most complex organ on earth and is found in many groups of animals (comparability) The more we learn about the brain, the more behavioural disorders we will be able to treat Studying the brain leads to a greater understanding of our variability/diversity Study of the brain brings insights to other fields of knowledge and is a source of employment (neuroscience) What is the brain? Neurons Specialised nervous system cells engaged in information processing Glial cells Nervous system cells supporting neuron function; providing insulation, nutrients, and support, as well as aiding in repairing neurons and eliminating waste products Central nervous system (CNS) The brain and spinal cord, which together mediate behaviour; this is the part of our nervous system encased in bone Peripheral nervous system (PNS) All of the neurons in the body outside of the brain and spinal cord Cerebrum (forebrain) A major structure of the forebrain, which consists of two mirror-image hemispheres (left and right) and is responsible for most conscious behaviour Hemispheres Hemisphere = “half-a-sphere”, referring to one side of the cerebrum Neocortex (cerebral cortex) Cortex = “bark” in latin Outermost layer (“outer bark”) of the forebrain that is visibly folded in humans and other large=brained animals, composed of about six layers of cells Brainstem Central structure of the brain (including the hindbrain, midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus) that is responsible for most life-sustaining, unconscious behaviour However there is a component of the brainstem that is specialised for learning and coordinating movements Cerebellum Major brainstem structure specialised for learning and coordinating movements; assists the cerebrum in generating many behaviours Ch2 describes the brain’s functional anatomy Embodied behaviour: Theory that the movements we make and the movements we perceive in others are central to communication Example: We understand one another by taking information from the language that we hear, in addition to expressions and body language – shows that the brain cannot be separated from the body’s actrions Locked-in syndrome A condition in which an individual is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally because of complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles except the eyes Martin Pistorius: Minimally conscious state (MCS) Condition in which a person can display some rudimentary behaviours, such as smiling or uttering a few words, but is not otherwise conscious Case Study: Clinical Trial Consensual experiment directed toward developing a treatment Researchers implanted electrodes in the brain of a patient in a minimally consious state due to brainstem damage from an assault Theory Believed that if they could stimulate the remaining brainstem using a small electrical current, it would improve wakefulness and enhance his behavioural abilities Method: Implanted small electrodes in the brainstem to administer the current Deep brain stimulation (DBS) Neurosurgical technique in which electrodes implanted in the brain stimulate a targeted area with a low voltage electrical current to produce behaviour or give relief from psychiatric conditions They applied the stimulation for 12 house each day Results: The patient was able to feed himself and swallow food During the stimulation he could interact with caregivers and watch television Improved further in response to rehabilitation Persistent vegetative state (PVS) Condition in which a person is alive but unaware, unable to communicate or to function independently at even the most basic level What is behaviour? Defining Behaviour: Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt in his textbook “Ethology: The Biology of Behavior (1970)” uses the following definition: “Behavior consists of patterns in time.” Patterns made up of movements, vocalisations, changes in expressions; The changes in the brain’s electrical and biochemical activity that are associated with thought, show that thinking is a behaviour that forms patterns in time Plasticity The body’s potential for physical or chemical change; enhances its adaptability to environmental change and its ability to compensate for injury Neuroplasticity Plasticity in the brain and nervous system Innate vs Learned Behaviours: This eating strategy ^^ is CULTURAL Much of the brain’s organisation prepares it not only to produce behaviour but also to change We can breed herding dogs through selective breeding (disposition) but those dogs will still need to be trained (learning) to be effective We retain inherited responses (i.e. suckling of breasts, automatic bodily functions (digestion, heartbeat, respiration)) and our preparedness to learn influences our ability to learn Questions arising from this perceived dichotomy of innate/learned: How does the brain inherit the organisation needed to produce organised behaviour How does the brain learn? Are the brain processes that produce inherited behaviours and learned behaviours the same? These questions become more relevant in robotics as we build machines innately capable of learning (AI) 1-2 Theories of Brain and Behavior LOQ: Chart the historical understanding of the mind from ancient concepts of psyche through mentalism, dualism, and materialism Explain the impact of genetics and inheritance on our contemporary understanding of brain and behaviour Summarise our contemporary understanding of consciousness Aristotle and Mentalism Aristotle suggested that all human intellectual functions are produced by a nonmatetrial entity called the psyche Aristotle did not believe that THE BRAIN, specifically, produces behaviour, and did not believe the psyche was in the human head Believed the brain existed to cool the blood Psyche Synonym for mind ; a nonmaterial entity once proposed to be the source of human behaviour (specifically consciousness, imagination, opinion, desire, pleasure, pain, memory, and reason This framework was named: Mentalism Explanation of behaviour as a function of the nonmaterial mind Modern psychological terminology draws from mentalism in that they are crafted to describe functions of the mind: Consciousness, sensation, perception, attention, imagination, emotion, motivation, memory, volition — are still used as descriptors of behaviour Descartes and Dualism Outlined his theories in Treatise on Man Descartes believed that the brain was the seat of the mind(psyche), and that the body was linked to the mind Deduced similarities between machines and behaviour: realising that mechanical principles could explain the brain’s functions (motion, digestion, breathing) The role of the pineal gland (according to Descartes): Suggested that the mind resides in the pineal gland The mind interacts with the body to produce movement It does this by working through the pineal gland The mind instructs the pineal body , which lies beside ventricles (fluid filled cavities in the brain), to direct fluid through nerves and into muscles Fluid → expanded muscles/movement The pineal gland actually influences daily and seasonal biorhythms (i.e. circadian) Dualism Philosophical position that both a nonmaterial mind and a material body contribute to behaviour The argument against dualism is that there is no way for a nonmaterial entity to influence the body would require the spontaneous generation of energy, violating the law of conservation of matter and energy Mind-body problem The difficulty of explaining how a nonmaterial mind and a material body interact Descartes proposed two tests for the presence of mind – based on the abilities to use language and remember: Believed that nonhuman animals and machines would be unable to pass the test because (he believed) they lacked a mind Contemporary Version: The Turing Test A test devised by Alan Turing (English Mathematician), in WWII which a machine could be judged conscious if an interrogator or judge could not distinguish its answers from those of a human (the judge would have to say whose responses were from the machine) The problem with this: Our willingness to interpret the appearance of intelligence as indicative of consciousness Also important to note that humans have been changed and influenced by AI, which influences how we judge the game Negative effects of the theory of dualism: People have argued that children and mentally ill peiple (in addition to machines and non human animals) lack minds because they fail to reason appropriately Led to the justification of poor treatment of animals, children, and the mentally ill Comparative Focus – 1-2: Speaking Brain Human language is unique in its ability to “merge” words and concepts to create an infinite number of concepts Evolutionary theory (contrarily) suggests that language did not initially appear in the full-blown form seen in modern humans Studying Chimps - Kanzi: Associates various peeps with specific foods Smacks her lips using the same rhythm humans use when speaking Emits raspberries + grunts to attract the attention of others Gesture with facial and arm movements when they vocalise to signal intent Two separate colonies who used different referential calls modified and merged their calls when the colonies were combined Theorised that this is the logical antecedent of human language (i.e. early humans would have sounded more like chimps) Brain scans: Show that (1) the same brain regions in the cortex important for human language are also present for chimpanzees Yerkish is a type of symbolic language developed for communication between humans and nonhuman primates Darwin and Materialism Evolution by Natural Selection Darwin proposed that small changes in physical and behavioural traits of animals, passed from parents to offspring, resulted in all species of living things (i.e. all living things are descended from a common ancestor) Natural Selection Darwin’s theory explaining how new species evolve and how existing species change over time; individuals with different characteristics (phenotypes) have differential reproductive success leading populations of living organisms to adapt and change Species A group of organisms that can interbreed Phenotype Set of individual characteristics (physical or behavioural traits) that can be seen or measured) Natrual Selection and Heritable Factors Mendelian genetics Principles of inheritance demonstrated in experience of Gregor Mendel, based on the observation that heritable factors (genes) pass from parent to offspring Genotype Particular genetic makeup of an individual Experiment 1-1: How do parents transmit heritable factors to offspring? Members of a species of a particular genotype are likely to express a similar phenotype If a gene or combinations of genes for a specific trait (i.e. flower color) is passed onto the offspring, then the offspring will express that trait Interplay of Genes, Environment, and Experience Even Mendel understood that the environment influences gene expression in some way or another (i.e. tall peas in poor soil reduces their height) We now know that genes can be active at different times and under different conditions during our life — this is referred to as: Epigenetics The study of how gene expression is turned on or off at different times and how environment and experience influence our behaviour through their effects on our genes Differences in gene expression related to environment and experience Summarising Materialism Because all animal species are related, their brains must be related Because all animal species are related, their behaviours must be related Brains and behaviours in complex animals such as humans evolved from simpler animals’ brains and behaviour Consciousness and other processes attributed to the mind must be a product of the nervous system Toward Contemporary Perspectives on Consciousness David O. Hebb - Organisation of Behaviour Argued that there is not a good reason to appeal to mental explanations for behaviour if attributes such as consciousness, pain, and attention can be explained by physical mechanisms Giulio Tononi – I ntegrated information theory of consciousness(IIT; also known as Phi theory) Proposed that the Phi network turns off as we sleep and turns back on again when we awake, and it is this waking activity that produces what we experience as consciousness Uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor the flow of oxygenated blood and provide info about which structures work together fMRI has revealed that functions of the brain (i.e. consiousness) are supported by networks (interactions of many regions and their connections) The Separate Realms of Science and Belief People question the assertion that only the brain is responsible for behaviour because they think it denies religion Materialism is neutral with respect to religion Many behavcioural scientists hold religious beliefs and see no contrafiction between them and their engagement with science – in part, because science is not a belief system Scientific Method - Procedure: Formulate a theory Make a prediction Test it Confirm or modify the theory 1-3 Evolution of Brains and Behaviour LOQ: Why is it important to understand common ancestry in order to understand how nervous systems developed across species? What were the steps in evolution that led from the earliest rudimentary nervous systems to the complex brains and nervous systems of the chordate phylum? The first animals to develop a nervous system and muscles for mobility The increasing complexity of the nervous system alongside the brain’s evolution to mediate more complex behaviours How the human brain evolved to the current level of complexity A common ancestor: Forebear of two or more lineages or family groups; ancestral to both groups Humans and other apes are descended from common ancestors In some ways modern chimpanzees are closer than humans to the common ancestor we share than modern humans – which allows chimpanzees to be used as a stand in for that ancestor Origin of Brain Cells and Brains 4.5 Billion years ago — the earth forms 3.5 billion years ago — the first life forms arise 700 million years ago — animals evolve their first brain cells 250 million years ago — the first brain had evolved 6 million years ago — the first human- like brain developed 200,000 years ago — the modern human brain developed Brain cells are recent compared to the age of life on earth Large, complex brains appeared an evolutionary ‘eyeblink’ ago Taxonomy: Evolution of Nervous Systems in Animals Note: most organisms, incl plants and bacteria, live without nervous systems - they are not essential In animals with a nervous system, the evidence suggest that it developed along the following general steps: Neurons and muscles Nerve net Simple nervous system that has no centre; consists of neurons that receive sensory information that connect directly to other neurons that move muscles Bilateral symmetry Body plan in which organs/parts present on both sides of the body are mirror images in appearance The human nervous system is bilaterally symmetrical Segmentation Division into a number of parts that are similar; refers to the idea that many animals, including vertebrates, are composed of similarly organised body segments Ganglia Collection of nerve cells that functions somewhat like a brain Spinal Cord Chordate An animal with both a brain and a spinal cord Chordates get their name from the notocord – a flexible embryonic structure that disintegrates as the spinal bones encase it 5 Markers(syncapomorphies) of a Chordate (not in tb): Presence of a notochord Hollow dorsal nerve cord Endostyle or thyroid Pharyngral slits Post-anal tail Brain The chordate phylum, of which amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are class members, displays the greatest degree of encephalisation The evolutionary increase of brain size relative to body size ( often associated w/ enhanced cognitive abilities) Chordate Brain Cladogram Diagram representing the relationship between organisms with branch points signifying possible common ancestors Table: Representative Classes of Chordates: 1-4 Evolution of the Human Brain, and Behaviour LOQ: What is the relationship between brain size and behavioural capacity in humans What are the ways of measuring brain size, and what mapping methods exist to describe brain complexity What behavioural changes were exhibited during the development of the hominin brain Humans are Members of the primate order We are one of an estimated 376 primate species Primate brains are larger on average than other mammalian orders Brain size tends to increase with the groupings in this cladogram Hominins: Term referring to all forms of humans, both living and extinct We are most closely related to the members of the genus pan – includes chimpanzees and bonobos Characteristics Diurnal (active in daylight) Trichromatic vision Brachiation (detached shoulder joints that allow for swinging) Australopithecus: Our Distant Ancestor Latin: Austral (southern) Greek: Pithekos (ape) = southern ape Many species of australopithecus likely existed Australopithacus africanus is likely our common ancestor ‘Lucy’ is the most complete skeleton ever found Significance: First primates to walk upright and use tools Evolved a well developed arch and unrotated big toe Brain morphology (form) was still more similar to nonhuman apes The first humans Proposed route for the first humans out of africa: Genesis of Brain Sizes: Homo habilis (“handy human”) Date back to Ethiopia 2.8 million years ago Fossils reveal a jaw + teeth smaller than any Australopithecus species Larger forebrain more similar to a human Homo erectus (“Upright Human”) Named due to the mistaken notion that H. habilis had a stooped posture Large brain — overlapping in size with measurements of present-day human brains Homo neanderthalis Named for the Neander Valley in Germany Had brains that were slightly larger than humans Lived in family groups, made music, cared for elders, buried dead Evidence that neanderthals and modern humans share common genes for creative traits (emotionality, self control, self awareness) H. sapiens sapiens (modern humans) Appeared about 200,000 years ago Coexisted + interbred with archaic neanderthals Replaced neanderthals between 20,000 – 40,000 years ago Theories of Human Extinction: Proposed advantages related to toolmaking, language use, and social organisation have been suggested as explanations for our dominance Modern European humans who inherited Neanderthals’ genes are often well adapted for cold Better able to ward off diseases Have lighter colored skin that better absorbs vitamin D More susceptible to severe covid 19 Artist’s reconstruction of a young neanderthal woman: Comparing human lineages (the bars overlap because many hominin species coexisted until recently): Relating brain complexity and behaviour 3 Ways of describing brain complexity Brain size, numbers of cells, and organisation Measuring brain size Fossil records only provide skull measurements where a measure of brain size can be inferred Encephalization quotient (EQ): Jerison’s quantitative measure of brain size obtained from the ratio of actual brain size to expected brain size, according to the principle of proper mass, for an animal of a particular body size Defined an average animal (domestic cat) as having an EQ of 1 Below the line: Brain size is smaller than would be expected for an animal of that size Above the line: Brain size is larger than would be expected for an animal of that size Modern humans have the highest EQ Problems with EQ: Body and brain size can and do vary independently Behavioural complexity can deviate from that faced by brain size Example: Apes lkike gorillas are specialised in having large bodies but apes like humans are specialised in having large brains Encephalisation Quotients: Counting and measuring brain cells Another way to estimate the behavioural capacity of the brain is to count brain cells The roundworm was the first animal to have it’s genome sequenced and neural connections described The roundworm has 959 cells, 302 of which are neurons In contrast, a blue whale weighing 200 tons has a brain weighing 33 ,bs Based on EQ ratios, we would estimate the roundworm would have a more complex behavioural repertoire than a blue whale This is why counting brain cells provides a better measure when the tissues are available Methods for Counting Brain cells: # of neurons /unit area is consistent in primates – so both EQ and brain cell count provide good brain size comparisons Australopithecus — 30 billion neurons H. Habilis — 60 billion neurons H. Erectus — 75 billion neurons H. sapiens — 86 billion neurons Modern humans have more brain cells than other apes because our brains are larger Difficulty of between-lineage comparisons Cell size – and thus packing density – can vary Cell counts in different brain regions can vary between lineages Example - Elephant Brains: Pachyderms (elephants, rhinos, hippos) have an enormous number of neurons, but most of them are found in the cerebellum (associated w/ motor behaviour) The # of neurons in their cortex are relatively equivalent to that of chimpanzees Essentially, it is the number of neurons in the cortex that determines capacity for advanced reasoning and complex thought Brain cell connections and brain maps This figure illustrates how the complexity of the brain evolves as more neurons are added: For animals with successively larger brains, the neurons representing primary functions aggregate (combine) to keep their connections short (top two figures) As their numbers increase, they begin to form new regions (grey shading) Example: Visual pathways to motor regions in a fish direct whole-body movements to guide the fish from one place to another Visual pathways in a primate not only guide locomotion but also guide control of the arm or hand for reaching Topographic: Representing function in different areas of the central nervous system The first column provides a topographic view of how the brain might change with the addition of neurons – with each color representing a function (i.e. vision, such, hearing) Analogous to a street map of routes Connectome All of the pathways connecting regions of the central nervous system I.e. the connections through which each of these regions influences the others The second column provides a correct view of how connections might change when neurons are added as topographic regions separate and become larger Analogous to a scene map of buildings Why the hominin brain became more complex Period of modern human emergence spans over 4 million years — much quicker than other species during this time The big Question: Why did hominens evolve a large brain with so many cells? Why did behaviour become more complex? Leading Theories The primate lifestyle Altered maturation Climate change Genetic mutation The primate lifestyle Robin Dunbar and the number 150: Argues that a primate’s social group size is correlated with brain complexity The average group size of about 150 favored by modern humans explains the brain: In that 150 is the estimated group size of hunter-gatherer groups, AS WELL as many contemporary institutions (military, commercial, etc) Fruit Foraging + Brain Size: Vegetation eaters such as gorillas do not have large brains compared to their body size Apes that eat fruit (such as humans + chimps) have large brains What is so special about fruit? Fruit harvesting requires: Color vision to see Good motor skills to reach + manipulate Goos spatial skills to find it Good memory to return to it Friends who can help find it and ward off competitors Payoff of eating fruit: Nutritional value for a large, energy-dependent brain that uses more than 20% of the body’s resources Same skills apply to forms of hunting The amount of energy consumed by neurons is believed to be relatively constant across species, but high relative to other types of cells Cooking: Both hot and cold cooking likely contribute to hominen brain evolution Hot cooking = the use of heat (aids in caloric digestion) Cold cooking = the use of tools Inter-gender cooperation in food gathering and cooking also supports the evolution of our brains — in that meals could be planned and food could be stored and accessed reliably, diminishing the amount of time needed for foraging Possible Genetic Mutations: Cooking makes food easier to eat May foster mutations associated with the exchange of movement strength for movement skill (i.e. shrunken, nimble masticatory muscles sufficient for chewing softer, cooked food) A small jaw distinguishes early homo fossils Altered maturation All animal species’ life history can be divided into stages Heterochrony The study of processes that regulate life stages (gestation, infancy, childhood, adulthood) and their developmental speed and duration) Several studies suggest that altered heterochrony is responsible for accelerated human brain development Neoteny: Says in which juvenile stages of predecessors become adult features of descendants; idea derived from the observation that more recently evolved species resemble the young of their common ancestors. Examples: Flightless birds are neotenic adult birds Demonsticated dogs are neotenic wolves Sheep are neotenic goats Many anatomical features link us with the juvenile stages of other primates Neoteny in Humans Infant heads are large relative to body size — The shape of a baby chimpanzee’s head is more similar to an adult human than an adult chimpanzees Primate Behaviours in Baby Humans: Play Exploration Interest in novelty and learning These processes are retained into adulthood (due to neoteny!) Evidence for neoteny is present in that periods of human development — gestation, infancy, childhood, adulthood — are extended relative to ancestral species Allows for production and development of more neurons and a bigger brain Climate change and the evolving hominin brain Massive tectonic activity 8 million years ago produced the ‘Great Rift Valley’ Ape species living in wetter climate to the west were cut off from species that evolved into hominins and adapted a drier climate to the east Other Climate Events: Evidence suggests that the warming in europe that ended the ice age 30,000 years ago was responsible for the disappearance of the neanderthal and other archaic proto-humans Impact of Warmer Climate and the Morphology of the Skull One hypothesis (Falk) posits that if the brain’s radiator (the circulating blood) evolved to form a more effective cooling system, that the brain size will increase in tandem The importance of brain cooling: Metabolic activity generates a lot of heat and the brain is at risk for overheating Falk: homo skulls contain holes through which cranial blood vessels pass – unlike earlier hominins – suggesting that we have a much more widely dispersed blood flow to the brain (which would greatly enhance cooling) The human genome Apes and modern humans share about 96% of DNA Small differences make it difficult to determine what each difference contributes Possible Genetic Mutations: Genes that are active when the cerebrum is developing, and also have a role in determining the number of neurons that compose the cerebrum Jumps in brain size potentially attributable to this mutation 3.4 million years ago — H. habilis 2.4 million years ago — erectus 1 million years ago — sapiens 1-5 Modern Human Brain Size, Intelligence, and Culture LOQ: What factors complicate measures and comparisons of complex behaviours, such as intelligence, within a species What is the role of culture and memes in the development of human behaviour Darwin’s Description of the Brain Size Paradox: No one, I presume, doubts the large proportion which the siz eof man's brain bears to his body, compared to the same proportion in the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his higher mental powers .... On the other hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two animals or of any two men can be accurately gauged by the cubic contents of their skulls. (Darwin, 1871, p. 37) Many have tried to tie individual intelligence to gross brain size Evolutionary approach: Based on comparisons between species Caution should be taken w hen extending evolutionary principles within a species — especially within or among groups of modern humans (i.e. eugenics) The Significance of Human Brain Size Comparisons Gould’s The Mismeasure of Man: Criticises studies that suggest brain size and intelligence are related Highlights the compounded difficulty of measuring intelligence Highlights that the primary motivation for much of the research in the area has been to support preconceived notions about sex, group, racial superiority Brain Weight and Body Mass: A tape measure placed around a person’s head does not factor in skull thickness Researchers disagree about whether volume or weight is a better measure To what extent should we factor in body mass in deciding whether a brain is large or small? How do we measure body mass, knowing that there are weight fluctuations The reasons for individual differences between the brain’s of individuals: People may have larger or smaller brain cells Larger people are likely to have a larger brain than smaller people because they have a larger muscle mass to control Men have a somewhat larger brain than women, but men are also proportionally larger Girls mature more quickly than boys do, so the differences that characterise adults may not exist As people age, they lose brain cells and the brain shrinks Neurological Diseases Accelarate the Age-Related Decrease: Brain injury near the time of birth may result in a decrease in brain size, even in regions distant from the damage Stress associated with need deprivation in infancy also reduces brain size Disorders associated with parental drug use during pregnancy (i.e. FASD) ASD produces a wide variety of different brain changes, including both increases and decreases Changes across life: Good nutrition in early years is related to brain size Plasticity is enhanced or hindered by the environment The Significance of Human Intelligence Species-typical behaviour: Behaviour that is characteristic of all members of a species, such as the songs or dances of birds or the eating behaviour of animals The difference in brain size between salamanders and sea lampreys can be attributed to the regions responsible for legs/lack thereof When we compare behaviour (i.e. intelligence) within a species, we are comparing how well someone performs over someone else The differences we are examining are likely comparatively small, vary according to the conditions under which measurements are made, and are difficult to objectively define Spearman + Intelligence Testing: Carried out the first formal performance analysis of various tests used to rate huma intellect Found a positive correlation among tests, and suggested that a single common factor (g factor; for general intelligence) explained them Confounds to g : Opportunity Interest level Training Motivation Health All of these factors moderate the outcome of the g factor, and the g factor is moderated by these factors Flynn Effect: The consistent generational increase in IQ, not attributable to a real increase in intelligence Thus, education and life experiences explain (mediate) the flynn effect Howard Gardener on Intelligence: Argued that humans have a number of intelligences — verbal, musical, mathematical, social, etc — and that each type of intelligence is dependent on corresponding functions of particular brain regions Criticised for its arbitrariness – easy to add or subtract one or another kind of intelligence Overlooked - Adaptive value of variation in abilities: A group composed of individuals with a variety of traits may be more adaptive than a hypothetical homogenous group Genetic and Phenotypic Variation – Evolutionary Biology: Populations that lack variation – due to inbreeding or bottleneck events — are at increased risk from environmental change and disease Similarly, behavioural variability can allow a group to innovate in novel ways The Significance of Human Culture Culture: Learned behaviours that are passed on from one generation to the next through teaching and imitation Human beings: Speak thousands of languages Have numerous social and religious practices Adapt to the world we live in The variability attributable to culture means that the behaviours that we engaged in are distinctly different from the behaviours of humans in the past see human behaviours that have actualised comparatively recently on an evolutionary scale … 30,000 years ago — modern humans create the first elaborate cave paintings 15,000 years ago — agriculture appears 7,000 years ago — reading and writing are invented Mathematics and Social Media: We are experiencing an age of smartphones and social media unique to human history The evolutionary model would suggest that the things that the human brain did to evolve contained the elements necessary for adapting to these more sophisticated skills Memes: An idea, a behaviour, or a style that spreads from person to person within a culture Named after ‘genes’ Memes can also be studied within an evolutionary framework Individual differences in brain structure may favor the development of certain memes The developed meme would exert selective pressure on further brain development Example: Chance variations in brain structure may have favored tool use for some individuals Now, toolmaking itself exerts selective pressure to favor individuals well skilled in tool fabrication CHAPTER 2 What Is the Nervous System’s Functional Anatomy? 2-1 Overview of Brain Function and Structure LOQ: What is neuroplasticity and how does it aid in adapting What are the major geographic structures and internal features of the brain What are the major divisions of the nervous system and how do they interact with each other Behaviour: A collection of coordinated movements that are internally generated, often in response to external stimuli Plastic Patterns of Neural Organisation Neuroplasticity: The nervous system’s potential to modify itself physically or chemically in response to environmental change and to compensate for age-related changes and injury Phenotypic Plascicity: An individual’s capacity to develop into a range of phenotypes Remember: epigenetics is the study of the influence of environmental and behavioural factors on gene expression independently of altering the underlying DNA sequence: These two mice are genetically identical but express very different phenotypes because their mothers were fed different supplements when pregnant: Functional Organisation of the Nervous System Anatomical Organisation: Functional Organisation: We are most interested in the functional approach: how the four parts of the nervous system interact with each other Somatic nervous system (SNS) Part of the peripheral nervous system including cranial and spinal nerves to and from muscles, joints, and skin. These nerves produce movement, transmit sensory input, and inform the CNS about the position and movement of body parts Autonomic Nervous system Part of the peripheral nervous system that regulates the functioning of internal organs and glands Parasympathetic (calming; rest and digest) Sympathetic (aroused; fight or flight) Enteric nervous system Mesh of neurons embedded in the lining of the gut, running from the esophagus through the colon; controls the gut Directional flow of neural info: Afferent (incoming): Conducting toward a CNS structure The nerves communicating pain when you step on a tack Efferent (outogoing): Conducting away from a CNS structure The nerves conducting the motor response to lift your foot Brain’s Surface Features Basics: Finding your Way Around the Brain Brain-Body Orientation Spatial Orientation – Nomenclature: Describing Locations in the Brain; A coronal section is cut in a vertical plane, from the crown of the head down, yielding a frontal view of the brain's internal structures. A horizontal section, so-called because the view or the cut falls along the horizon, is usually viewed looking down on the brain from above-a dorsal view. A sagittal section is cut lengthways from front to back and viewed from the side. (Imagine the brain split by an arrow — in Latin, sagitta.) Here, a cut in the midsagittal plane divides the brain into symmetrical halves, a medial view. ` Brain-body orientation illustrates brain structure location from the frame of reference of the human face Spatial orientation illustrates brain structure location in relation to other body parts and body orientation Anatomical orientation illustrates the direction of a cut, or section, through the human brain (Part A) from the perspective of a viewer (Part B) Glossary of Anatomical Location and Orientation: Term Meaning with respect to the nervous system Anterior Near or toward the front of the animal or the front of the head (see also frontal and rostral ) Caudal Near or toward the tail of the animal (see also posterior ) Coronal Cut vertically from the crown of the head down; used to reference the plane of a brain section that reveals a frontal view Dorsal On or toward the back of a four-legged animal (equivalent to posterior for the human spinal cord); in reference to human brain nuclei, above, and to brain sections, viewed from above Frontal Of the front (see also anterior and rostral ); in reference to brain sections, a viewing orientation from the front Horizontal Cut along the horizon; used to reference the plane of a brain section that reveals a dorsal view Inferior Below (see also ventral ) Lateral Toward the side of the body or brain Medial Toward the middle, specifically the body’s midline;

a cut in the midsagittal plane divides the brain into symmetrical halves Superior Above (see also dorsal) Ventral On or toward the belly of four-legged animals (see also inferior ); in reference to human brain nuclei, below Protecting the Nervous System Meninges: Three layers of protective tissue — dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater — that encase the brain and spinal cord (CNS) Cerebrospinal fluid: Clear solution of sodium, chloride, and other ions that is produced in the ventricles inside the brain and circulates around the brain and spinal cord until it is absorbed beneath the arachnoid later in the subarachnoid space Cerebral Geography Cerebral Cortex: Heavily folded and layered tissue that forms the outer structure of the forebrain; composed of the neocortex and allocortex Frontal lobe Lobe of the neocortex that lies anterior to the central sulcus and beneath the frontal bone of the skull Responsible for performing the brain’s executive functions such as decision making and voluntary movement Parietal lobe Lobe of the neocortex that lies beneath the parietal bone of the skull Directs our movements for performing tasks Temporal lobe Lobe of the neotortex that lies beneath the temporal bone of the skull Constructs higher order hearing, language, musical abilities, facial recognition and emotional processing Occipital lobe Lobe of the neocortex that lies beneath the occipital bone Responsible for visual scene processing Examining the Brain’s Surface from All Angles Gyri (sing. gyrus): Small protrusions or bumps formed by the folding of the cerebral cortex Sulci (sing. sulcus): Grooves in brain matter, as are found in the neocortex or cerebellum Cerebral Circulation Stroke: Sudden appearance of neurological symptoms as a result of severely reduced blood flow Diagram of Cerebral Arteries Middle, anterior, posterior Brain’s Internal Features Macroscopic Inspection: Regions and Hemispheres The brain’s interior is not homogenous — variation in color and texture indicative of different brain components: Grey Matter: Areas of the nervous system composed predominantly of neuronal cell bodies and capillary blood vessels White matter: Areas of the nervous system composed mainly of myelin sheathed axons Ventricles: Cavities in the brain that make and contain cerebrospinal fluid The brain’s 4 ventricles are filled with CSF made by a network of blood vessels called the choroid plexus, which lines the ventricles CSF flows from the two lateral ventricles to the third and fourth ventricles on the brain’s midline — and into the cerebral aqueduct: A canal that runs down the length of the spinal cord Sagittal Section — Vertically front front to back: If we divide the cerebrum into two hemispheres, we see a long band of white matter Corpus callosum: Band of white matter containing approximately 200 million nerve fibers, which connects the two cerebral hemispheres to provide a route for direct communication between them Subcortical regions: (below the cortex) Regions of the brain that make intimate reciprocal connections with cortical areas that process sensory, perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions Bilateral symmetry, and the lack therof: The brain has two of the majority of its structures – and they are nearly identical Structural asymmetry can be found in neocortical auditory areas In right handed people, the planum temporale – a structure responsible for understanding speech — is larger in the left hemisphere, whereas Heschl’s gyrus — structure responsible for analysing music — is larger on the right Other one-of-a-kind structures: Third and fourth ventricles (brain’s midline) Pineal gland (straddles the two hemispheres) Microscopic Inspection: Cells and Fibers Nuclei (sing. nucleus): A group of neurons forming a cluster than can be identified using special stains FIGURE 2-12 Cortical Layers and Glia Brain sections from the left hemisphere of a monkey (midline is to the left in each image), viewed through a microscope. Cells are stained with (A and C) a selective cell body stain for neurons (gray matter) and (B and D) a selective fiber stain for insulating glial cells, or myelin (white matter). The images reveal very different views of the brain at the macro (A and B) and microscopic (C and D) levels. Features of Neurons: nerve(tract): Large collection of aces coursing together inside the central nervous system 2-2 The Conserved Pattern of Nervous System Development LOQ: Chart the evolutionary development of the brain from early vertebrate organisms to humans Comparative Brain Evolution The adult brains of fish, amphibians, and reptiles are roughly equivalent to this three-part brain^^^ Prosencephalon (front brain) — olfaction Mesencephalon (middle brain) — vision and hearing Rhombencephalon (hindbrain) — movement and balance [ the spinal cord is the hindbrain] In mammalian embryos: Prosencephalon → Diencephalon (between brain) The subcortical structures that develop further from the prosencephalon in mammalian embryos → Telencephalon (endbrain) Comprises the cerebral hemispheres and cortical areas Recombencephalon → Metencephalon (across brain) Includes the cerebellum → Mylencephalon (spinal brain) The Nervous System and Intelligent Behaviour Does intelligent behaviour require a vertebrate nervous system? One major insight here is that there are multiple evolutionary paths to intelligence 2-3 Central Nervous System: Mediating Behaviour LOQ Describe the primary functions of the brainstem, forebrain, cerebral cortex, and basal ganglia Explain the features and functions that differentiate the allocortex and the neocortex Explain how the organisation of the neocortical layers distinguishes this structure from other brain structures Identify the four major cortical lobes and summarise their primary functions Spinal Cord Through it’s connections to muscles, the spinal cord executes most of the bodies movements ( usually following instructions from the brain) Spinal Reflexes and the Somatic Nervous System The spinal cord is not a single structure — it is a set of segmented switching stations Each spinal segment receives information from a discrete part of the body, and in turn, send out commands to that area Brainstem Brainstem Central structure of the brain (including the hindbrain, midbrain, thalamus, and hypothalamus) that is responsible for most life-sustaining, unconscious behaviour The brainstem can be divided into 3 regions: Hindbrain Evolutionarily the oldest part of the brain; contains the pons, medulla, reticular formation, and cerebellum (the structures that coordinate movements) The human cerebellum has left and right hemispheres, a folded cortex with grey and white matter, and subcortical nuclei Pons: Contain nuclei that receive inputs from the cerebellum and form a ‘bridge’ from it to the rest of the brain Medulla: The medulla’s nuclei regulate vital functions such as respiration and cardiovascular function (this is why a blow to the back of the head can kill you) Reticular formation (reticular activating system): Brainstem area in which nuclei and fiber pathways are mixed, providing a netlike appearance; associated with sleep-wake behaviour and behavioural arousal Midbrain Central part of the brain; contains neural circuits for hearing and seeing as well as for orienting movements Tectum (roof) Roof (area above the ventricle) of the midbrain; role in visual and auditory sensory processing and producing orienting movements Superior colliculus: receives visual input Inferior colliculus: receives auditory input Tegmentum (floor) Floor (area below the ventricle of the midbrain); a collection of nuclei with movement-related, species-specific, and pain perception functions Orienting movements Movement directed to sensory input, such as the turning of the head to see the source of a sound Structures in the brain are critical for producing orienting movements, simple pattern recognition of visual / auditory stimuli, species specific behaviours, and pain perception The tegmentum in cross section, revealing various nuclei. Colleculus comes from collis (latin for ‘hill’) . The colliculi resemble four little hills on the midbrain’s posterior surface Diencephalon The ‘between brain’, which integrates sensory and motor information on its way to the cerebral cortex The diencephalon (center) is composed of the epithalamus, which includes the pineal gland, the thalamus (shown at right), the hypothalamus (the posterior portion of the pituitary gland, shown at left ), and the subthalamus. Thalamic regions connect to discrete cortical regions. Below the thalamus, at the base of the brain, the hypothalamus (in Latin, hypo means “below”) and pituitary lie above the roof of the mouth. The hypothalamus is a diencephalon structure that contains many nuclei mediating regulatory functions such as hunger and thirst Hormone production: The hypothalamus produces neurohormones that stimulate the pituitary to secrete releasing hormones in the circulatory system The pituitary hormones, in turn, influence the endocrine glands to release appropriate hormones into the bloodstream and send feedback to the brain about the need for more or less hormone release Thalamus: Diencephalon structure through which information from all sensory systems is organised, integrated, and projected into the appropriate region of the neocortex Main Function — Orgaise + Integrate information travelling to the cortex: Lateral geniculate nucleus A thalamic region that processes information from the opci tract and sends it to the visual regions in the occipital lobes Dorsomedial thalamic nucleus Thalamic region that integrates information from olfactory stimuli; plays a vital role in attention, planning, thinking, and memory Other thalamic regions have motor functions, (1) receiving input from the regions where decisions about possible movements are made , and (2) relaying information to movement planning areas in the neocortex Forebrain Evolutionarily the most recent addition to the brain; coordinates advanced cognitive functions such as thinking, planning, and language; contains the allocortex, neocortex, and basal ganglia Cerebral Cortex Neocortex: Outermost layer (“new bark”) of the forebrain that is visibly folded in humans and other large-brained animals; composed of about six layers of cells The brains of a Rhesus monkey, chimp, and human, shown here to scale, differ drastically in size and surface appearance Note: the reason that the cerebellum contains 80 % of our neurons despite being so much smaller is because it’s neurons are smaller and more densely packed Lissencephalic: Describing a condition where the brain has no sulci or gyri and thus a smooth appearance Gyrencephalic: Describing a condition of brains with large neocortical sheets repeatedly folding in on itself so it fits into the restricted space of the skull Some research has shown that most connections of cells in the cortex are to neighboring cells, and tend to pull those cells toward each other Therefore, cells in a functional area that have many connections fold towards each other, producing a gyrus bordered by sulci Allocortex Part of the cerebral cortex (“outer bark”) composed of three or four layers; plays a role in controlling motivational and emotional states as well as in certain forms of memory Hippocampus: A brain structure responsible for memory consolidation : The process whereby short term memories are solidified into long term memories Damage to the hippocampus leads to problems with navigation, finding our way around, and difficulties with word finding Amygdala: Brain region playing a role in fear and anxiety Cingulate cortex A cortical structure above the corpus callosum (close to the midline), involved with emotion forming and processing, learning and memory, and is highly influential in linking behavioural outcomes to motivation The Concept of the Limbic System Limbic system A conceptual system controlling affective and motivated behaviours and certain forms of memory, whose key anatomy lies between the neocortex and brainstem; includes the cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus (among other structures) In the 1930s, brain regions controlling these behaviours had not been identified The function of the allocortex (what was then known as the limbus, or border, of the brain) was not yet known The leading theory was that the limbic structures played a role in emotion and sexuality Contraversy: Scientists disagree on which anatomical structures should be considered part of the limbic system The original view that the limbic system was the emotional centre and the neocortex was the cognitive centre doesn’t work — because cognition depends on acquisition and recention of memories, and the hippocampus — an allocortical structure — plays a role in these functions Recent viewpoints: arguments for the term limbic system to be abandoned Specific circuits for specific functions can be traced through several allocortical, neocortical, and brainstem structures See ch2 + ch 14-3 Olfactory system Smell is one of the first sense to have evolved in animals Curious that the olfsactory system lies at the front of the human brain and is considered part of the forebrain In mammals, olfactory receptors send their inputs to the pyriform cortex in simpler brains, their input to the brainstem is more direct Vomeronasal organ (VNO): Collection of neurons that detect pheromones; plays a role in reproduction and social behaviour in many mammals (specific function in humans is disputed) Neocortical Layers The neocortex is composed of six layers of grey matter, the white matter structure of neocortical axons that joins the two Different layers have different types cells Cell density varies from layer to layer, ranging from virtually no cells in layer I to a very dense cell packing in layer IV Other differences in appearance are both regional and functional Cytoarchitectonic map: Map of the neocortex based on the organisation, structure, and distribution of the cells Brodmann (1909) defined areas based on the organisation and characteristics of cells he examined The regions shown in color are associated with the simplest sensory perceptions: Touch = RED Vision = PURPLE Hearing = ORANGE The neocortical areas that process sensory information are far more extensive than these basic areas We now have multimodal brain maps that integrate information from MRIs and other techniques FACT Definition of a functional area Each area is defined by its: F unction A natomy C onnections T opography Using this definition, we are able to subdivide cortical regions into a map of 180 cortical areas (compared to Brodmann’s 52) The Cortex as a Functional Area — relation to others: One of the differences between the organisation of the neocortex and the organisation of other brain parts is the neocortex’s range of connections (unlike most structures) the neocortex is connected to almost all other parts of the brain Makes it difficult to identify specific neocortical functions Complicates our study of the rest of the brain because we must consider the neocortex’s cole in other regions Cortical Lobes Each hemisphere is subdivided into four lobes corresponding to the skull bones overlying them: Frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital Because bone location + brain function are unrelated, the cortical lobes are arbitrarily defined and include many functional zones: General Mapping of Cortical Bounderies: Effects of Injuries to Each Lobe: Frontal May have difficulty organising and evaluating their ongoing behaviour, as well as planning for the future Parietal May have difficulty identifying or locating stimulation on the skin and may experience deficits moving the arms and hands to certain positions Temporal May result in difficulty recognising sounds, although (unlike occipital injuries) individuals with temporal injury can still recognise that they are hearing something Can also cause difficulties in processing complex visual information, such as faces Occipital Deficits in processing visual information Although they may perceive light versus dark, they may be unable to identify the shape or color of objects Fissures and sulci establish the boundaries of cortical lobes In humans, the central sulcus and lateral fissure form the boundaries of each frontal lobe as well as the boundaries of each parietal lobe posterior to the central sulcus The lateral fissure demarcates each temporal lobe, forming its dorsal boundary The occipital lobes are separated from the parietal lobes by the parieto-occipital sulcus The fi Basal Ganglia Subcortical forebrain nuclei that coordinate voluntary movements of the limbs and body; connected toe the thalamus and to the midbrain Parkinson disease: Motor system disorder correlated with dopamine loss in the substantia nigra; characterised by tremors, muscular rigidity, and reduction in voluntary movement Tourette syndrome: Disorder of the motor systems characterised by involuntary vocalisations and odd involuntary movements of the head, face, and body These are disorders of controlling movements — not producing them (i.e. paralysis) Therefore, the basal ganglia must play a role in coordinating and controlling movement patterns, rather than in activating the muscles to move 2-4 Somatic Nervous System: Transmitting Information LOQ: Descrube the relationship between the somatic nervous system and the CNS Explain how the connections between spinal nerves facilitate coordinated movement Cranial Nerves Cranial Nerves: The 12 nerve pairs that control sensory and motor functions in the head, neck, and internal organs Each of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves has a different function. A common mnemonic device for learning the order of the cranial nerves is “ O n O ld O lympus’s T owering T op, A F inn A nd G erman V iew S ome H ops.” One set of 12 controls the left size of the head, and the other controls for the right side This makes sense for structures that are present bilaterally; it is not clear why separate nerve structures control the left and right sides of a single structure (i.e. the tongue) Spinal (peripheral) Nerves The spinal cord lies inside the bony spinal column Vertebrae (sing. vertebra) The bones that form the spinal column Organised into five anatomical regions from top to bottom – Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal Each segment corresponds to a legion of the body surface (a dermatome) identified by the segment number Dermatome: Meaning “skin cut”; a body segment corresponding to a segment of the spinal cord “Patchwork” Structure of the Human Spine: Because our limbs may originate in one spinal segment but extend past others, our segments fall into an arrangement that would make more sense if the arms were extended as they are when we walk on all fours Comparing Spinal and Cranial Nerves: Cranial nerve: Receives information from sensory receptors in the eyes, ears, facial skin, etc Spinal nerve Receives information from sensory receptors in the rest of the body (peripheral nervous system) Somatic Nervous System Connections LOQ: Describe the relationship between the somatic nervous system and central nervous system. Summarize the law of Bell and Magendie. Explain how the connections between spinal nerves facilitate coordinated movement. 1. Fibers entering the posterior (sensory) root bring sensory information from sensory receptors. 2. Fibers leaving the anterior root carry motor information to the muscles. 3. Collateral branches of sensory neurons may cross to the other side and influence motor neurons there. 4. White-matter fiber tracts carry information to and from the brain. (B) A photo shows the posterior view of an exposed and intact human spinal cord. A: Cross section of the spinal cord from the front The (butterfly shaped) inner regions consist of nerve cell bodies (grey matter) The outer regions consist of nerve tracts (white matter) travelling to and from the brain B: A posterior view shows the intact human spinal cord Law of Bell and Magendie: Sensory fibers are dorsal/posterior and motor fibres are ventral/anterior Integrating Spinal Functions In addition to its segmental organisation, the spinal cord must somehow coordinate different inputs and outputs across different segments Example: Many bodily movements involve coordinating muscles controlled by different segments The segments are interconnected in a way that adjacent segments can operate together to direct complex coordinated movements 2-5 Autonomic and Enteric Nervous Systems: Visceral Relations LOQ: Compare and contrast the functions of the autonomic and enteric nervous systems, and explain how each interacts with the central nervous system Describe the two major divisions of the ANS: ANS: Regulating Internal Functions Sypmpathetic division: Part of the autonomic nervous system that arouses the body for action, such as mediating the involuntary fight-or-flight response to alarm by increasing heart rate and blood pressure Parasympathetic division: Part of the autonomic nervous system that acts in opposition to the sympathetic nervous system — for example, preparing the body to rest and digest by revering the alarm or stimulating digestion Like the SNS, the ANS interacts with the rest of the nervous system and forms ipsilateral (on the same point of the body as another structure) connections Activation of the sympathetic division starts in the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord regions (although spinal nerves do not directly control the organs) Instead controlled by Ganglia – which control the inner organs, with each acting as aminibrain for specific organs Activation of the parasympathetic division derives from three cranial nerves: Vagus nerve: calms most of the internal organs Facial nerves: control salivation Oculomotor nerves: control pupil dilation Locations of Ganglia in both parts of the ANS: Left: arousing sympathetic fibres connect to a chain of ganglia near the spinal cord Right: calming parasympathetic fibres connect to individual ganglia near target organs ENS: Controlling the Gut The ENS functions largely independently of the ANS Digestion: Some evolutionary biologists have proposed that the CNS evolved from the gut of very early multicellular organisms The ENS is sometimes called the second brain because (like the CNS) it contains: A wide range of neuron times The same chemical transmitters A profusion of flail cells Complex integrated neural circuits 200 m – 500m neurons = the # of neurons found in the spinal cord Plexus: A sheet of tissue lining the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon The illustration shows the nervous system of a human along with the gastrointestinal tract: These tissue layers are enveloped by a fold of tissue named mesentery. Mesentery attaches the gut to the internal body wall. A nerve, an artery, and a vein enter the four tissue layers through the mesentery. The outermost tissue layer is thin whereas the next two layers are thick and contain a network of nerves that end in ovoid structures labeled myenteric plexus (ganglia). The nerve network also spreads over the innermost tissue layer surrounding the central gut tube and has nodes labeled submucosal plexus (ganglia) . Lumen, where digestion occurs. No nerves enter this area. Approximately 3.9 x 10 13 microbiota populate the adult gut, outnumbering the host cells by a factor of 1.3 Microbiome: The interaction of the ENS with gut bacteria Psychobiotics: A class of compounds containing live microorganisms, administered to treat behavioural disorders 2-6 Ten Principles of Nervous System Function LOQ: List the ten principles of nervous system function Define neuronal circuits and explain their importance in facilitating behaviour Explain why neural plasticity is described as the hallmark of nervous system functioning Neuronal circuits are functional units of the nervous system Neuronal circuit: A series of neurons interconnected by synapses that subserve a function when activated Monosynaptic circuit Neural circuits in which there is one synapse — they are the fastest because there is no delay of routing signals to the brain Regulate simple reflexes such as the patellar reflex: Polysynaptic circuits: Neural circuits in which at least one interneuron comes between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron increasing the total number of synapses; are slower than monosynaptic circuits Each synapse in a neural circuit adds about a 1–4 millisecond delay The larger a number of synaptically connected neurons in a circuit, the slower that circuit will be Sensory and motor division pervade the nervous system The separation of sensory and motor functions described by the Bell and Magendie law exists throughout the nervous system The lower brainstem regions (hindbrain and midbrain) are extensions of the spinal cord, and retain its divisions: Sensory structures located posterioritly Motor structures located anteriorily An important midbrain function is orienting the body to stimuli: Takes sensory input from the midbrain’s colliculi (posterior in the human tectum) Motor output — which the tegmentum (anterior) controls Sensory nuclei in the thalamus: The thalamus con tains separate nuclei associated with vision, hearing, and touch, and movements Divisions of sensory and motor functions in the cortex: Separate sensory and motor cortical regions process a particular set of sensory inputs (i.e. vision, hearing, touch). Other regions control find movements of discrete body parts, such as the fingers Entire cortex is organised around sensory and motor distinction. Layer IV of the cortex always receives sensory inputs, Layers V and VI always send motor inputs Layers I, II, and III integrate sensory and motor operations Sensory and motor systems work together at all levels: Example: The pupil (a motor structure) controls the amount of light that falls on the sensory retina Within muscles: A sensory system called the intrafusal muscle system detects the amount and rate of change of extrafusal muscles which do the work The CNS functions on multiple levels and is organised hierarchically and in parallel Hierarchically: A hierachical circuit hooks up with a linear series of regions that are all connected with a particular function In parallel: The hierarchical circuits function in tandem with parallel circuits with organise the hierarchies categorically A: simple hierarchical model of serial cortical processing B: in a distributed hierarchical processing model, each of the severa; processing streams has multiple levels, with areas at each level interconnecting Many brain circuits are crossed Crossed = they serve the opposite side of the body Each hemisphere receives sensory stimulation from the opposite (contralateral) side of the body and controls muscles on the contralateral side A crossed nervous system must join both sides of the perceptual world together The corpus callosum (with 200 million nerve fibres) joins the left and right cerebral. Hemispheres allowing them to interact 4 Exceptions to the crossed-circuit principle: Olfactory sensation Olfactory information projects directly to the same (ipsilateral) side of the brain Somatic connections The cranial and spinal nerves are connected ipsilaterally Autonomic connections The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system division connections are ipsilateral PNS connections Brain functions are localised and distributed Early brain research was rife with debate about whether different functions are localised to specific brain regions Advocates for localisation = Paul Broca + Carl Wernicke: Broca: Found that when damage occurs to the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobes, people are unable to produce language Wernicke Found that when damage occurs to the left posterior temporal gyrus, deficits in language comprehension result Brain regions are also distributed: Neurons in a specific region receive inputs, make internal connections within that region, and send outputs Because functions are both localised to specific areas and distributed within those areas, we see paradoxical effects when certain types of brain damage occur Complete or nearly complete damage to a fairly localised region can cause irreversible loss of function. BUT widespread but diffuse damage can leave people’s abilities generally intact Alzheimer disease: A degenerative brain disorder related to aging; first appears as progressive memory loss and later develops into generalised dementia Evidence of distribution in AD is present in how individuals experience severe memory loss but largely retain language function until later on in the disease The brain is symmetrical and asymmetrical Cortical asymmetry is essential for integrative tasks, including language and body control: Speaking: If a language zone existed in both hemispheres, each connected to one side of the mouth, we could be able to talk out of both sides of our mouth at once We locate language control of the mouth in one side of the brain (usually the left side) and spatial functions on the other (usually the right) In the bird brain, control of singing is in one hemisphere (as for human language) Likely that humans and birds evolved this way separately The nervous system works by juxtaposing excitation and inhibition The brain has an equal role in making movements that it does in inhibiting them: Excitation: Increase in the activity of a neuron or brain area Inhibition: Activity that decreases the action of a neuron or brain area All neurons evince a spontaneous activity rate that can either be increased (exitation) or decreased (inhibition) Some neurons excite others; some inhibit them Both effects are psoruced by neuronal communication via neurochemicals that cause specific ion channels to open (see ch3–5) The brain divides sensory input for object recognition and movement Sensory system first evolved for influencing movement, not recognising things This is why simple organisms can detect stimulation such as light and move toward or from it Visual information in the cortical circuit travels from the eyes → thalamus → visual regions in occipital lobe Then diverges along two separate pathways Dorsal stream Leads to the temporal lobe for object identification People with dorsal stream damage will struggle to make clumsy reaching movements because they do not form the appropriate hand postures until they contact objects and shape the hand on the basis of tactile information Ventral stream Leads to the parietal lobe to guide movements relative to objects People with ventral stream damage cannot distinguish between objects Recognising that perception for movement and perception for object recognition are independent processes has 3 important implications for understanding brain organisation: The dorsal and ventral visual systems also exemplify parallel information processing (principle 3) in the brain Although we may think we are arware of our entire sensory world, the sensory analysis required for some movements is clearly not conscious Unconsious and conscious brain processing underlies an important difference in our cognitive functions. The unconscious movement system is always acting in the present and in response to outgoing sensory input The conscious object recognition system allows us to escape the present and recall information from the past ( forming the neural basis of enduring memory) The nervous system produces movement in a perceptual world the brain constructs The fundamental function of the nervous system is to produce movements that make up beheaviours Movements are made up of a myriad of sensations, memories, and other forces and factors We tend to think that the world we percieve is what is actually there Rather, the brain of each individual develops in a particular set of environmental circumstrances on a plan common to that species The behaviour that the brain produces is directly related to / contingent on – the world that the brain has constructed Neuroplasticity is the hallmark of nervous system functioning Experience alter’s the brain’s organisation, and this is requisite to learning and memory In fact, the nervous system only stores information if the neural connections change (i.e. forgetting is due to a loss of connections that represented the memory) E.g. Cerebellar agenesis (research focus 2-1): If the cerebellum fails to develop, we would be missing 80% of our neurons The condition can cause distinctive speaking patterns, gaits, and difficulties with balance – cognitive: deficits in planning and abstract thinking Social skill + long term memory tend to be minimally affected Individuals with this condition have more slowly developing language and motor functions, but tend to show significant improvement over time and seem to compensate for many of their symptoms (neuroplasticity) CHAPTER 3 What Are the Nervous System’s Functional Units? 3-1 Cells of the Nervous System LOQ: What are the major structures of the neuron and their basic functions in information processing What are the five major types of neurons, and their primary functions What are the five major types of glial cells and what are their functions Neurons: the basis of information processing Golgi: Immersed a slice of brain tissue into a solution of silver nitrite + other chemicals Interpreted the result as suggesting that the nervous system is an interconnected “nerve net” that information flowed through, producing behaviour Santiago Ramon y Cajal: Used Golgi’s stain to study chick embryo’s brain tissue Assumed that the chick’s developing nervous system would be simpler than that of an adult chicken Concluded that the nervous system is made up of discrete cells – which begin life as simple structures + increase in complexity with age Cajal’s Neuron theory: The theory that neurons are the nervous system’s functional units, that interactions between neurons enable behaviour, and that the more neurons an animal has, the more complex its behaviour will be This is now the accepted theory of brain organisations A: tissue preparation revealing human pyramidial cells stained using the golgi technique B: Cajal’s drawing of a single Purkinje neuron made from Golgi-stained tissue Perineuronal net: (Later research found) a structure similar in appearance to Golgi’s nerve net that forms around neurons as they mature Now, additional techniques exist, including the use of endoscopes and microendoscopes (tiny microscopes that look into tissue) Cell body (soma) (from the Greek for ‘body’): Core region of the cell containing the nucleus and other organelles for making proteins Dendrites (from the Greek for “tree”): Branching extension of a neuron’s cell membrane; greatly increases the cell’s surface area; collects information from other cells Axon (from the Greek for “axle”): The root, or single fibre, of a neuron that carries messages to other neurons The human nervous system contains 86 billion neurons and 85 billion glial cells that support their functions (this 1:1 ratio characterises the brains of all animals) Neurons: the basis of information processing Neural networks: Functional group of neurons that connects wide areas of the brain and spinal cord Structure and function of the neuron Dendritic spines: Protrusion that greatly increases the dendrite's surface area; typical point of contact with the axons of other cells A neuron may have up to 20 dendrites, and each dendrite may have between one and many branches; the spines may number in the thousands Axon hillock (little hill) Juncture of the soma and axon Axon collaterals: Branch of an axon Collaterals divide further into m ultiple smaller branches (called telodendria, or end branches) Terminal button (end foot) Knob at the tip of an axon that conveys information to other neurons Synapse: Spatial junction between one neuron and another; forms the information transfer site between neurons The general shape of a neuron suggests that it works in a way broadly similar to a river: Information from other neurons is collected at dendrites Processed in the cell body And passed on to the axon And then to the terminal, where it is passed on to its target Three functions of neurons Sensory neurons of many types detect simulation or collect information and pass it on to… An interneuron. The multibranched interneuron dendrites collect information from varied sources and link to… Motor neurons, which are distinctively large and which pass commands to muscles to move Sensory neurons Cell that detects or carries sensory information into the spinal cord and brain Somatosensory neuron: Brain cell that brings sensory information from the body into the spinal cord Interneurons Association cell interposed between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron; in mammals, interneurons constitute most of the brain’s neurons Also called association cells – because of their linking properties One of the main reasons that brain sizes vary between species is that larger brains contain many more interneurons — with the interneuron number being correlated with behavioural complecxity Pyramidial cell A distinctively shaped interneuron found in the cerebral cortex; has a long axon, a pyramid shaped cell body, and two sets of dendrites Apical dendries Project from the cell body axis Basal dendrites project from the base of the cell body Pyramidal cells carry information from the cortex to the rest of the brain and spinal cord Purkinje cell Distinctively shaped interneuron found in the cerebellum; carries information from the cerebellum to the rest of the brain and spinal cord Motor neurons Cell that carries efferent information from the brain and spinal cord to make muscles contract Have extensive dendritic networks that collect information from many sources, large cell bodies, and long axon that connect to muscles Found in the lower brainstem and spinal cord — all efferent (outgoing) neural information must pass through them to reach the muscles Neuronal networks Sensory neurons collect afferant (incoming) information from the body → then connect to interneurons that process the information and pass it onto…. Motor neurons , whose efferent connections move muscles in order to produce behaviour Neurons that project for long distances (i.e. somatosensory, pyramidial, and motor neurons) are relatively large Long vs Short extensions Generally, neurons with a large cell body have long extensions Long extensions carry information to distant parts of the nervous system Neurons with a small cell body (i.e. stellate interneurons) have short extensions Short extensions are engaged in local processing Example: The dendrite tips of some somatosensory neurons are in your big toe Whereas some targets of their axons are at the base of your brain These sensory neurons send information over a large distance The size of some (larger) pyramidal cell bodies accord with the work they must do in providing nutrients and other cellular supplies for its axons and dendrites The language of neurons: excitation and inhibition Neurons either excite (turn on) or inhibit (turn off) Neurons send yes or no signals to one another (yes = excitatory; no = inhibitory) Because a neuron can recieve thousands of yes/no signals every second and vary its message in relation to those signals, it functions as a radio or speaker; can produce a variable signal (more complex than just yes and no) Members of a neuronal network can detect sensory information and “decide” what kind of motor response to make to that information Relation to neuromorphic computing, machine learning, and AI Researchers construct robotic models based on computer-based learning methods to help confirm hypotheses Classes of glial cells Ependymal cells’ Glial cells that make and secrete cerebrospinal fluid; found on the walls of the brain’s ventricles Astroglia Astrocytes: star -shaped glial cell that provides structural support to CNS neurons and transports substances between neurons and blood vessels Blood-brain barrier: Protective partition between the blood and the brain formed by tight junctions between the cells that compose blood vessels in the brain; prohibits entry of an array of substances, including toxins, into the brain Astrocyte processes attach to neurons and to blood vessel cells, stimulating them to form tight junctions and so form the blood–brain barrier. Astrocytes also move nutrients and other chemicals between blood vessels and neurons, support brain structures, and stimulate repair of damaged brain tissue. Microglia Glial cells that originate in the blood, aid in cell repair, and scavenge debris in the nervous system FIGURE 3-8 Detecting Brain Damage(A)Arrows indicate the red nucleus in a rat brain.

factory analogy to describe the cell’s internal structure Explain how the cell membrane regulates the flow of substances into and out of the cell Describe how proteins are manufactured in the cell and the role these proteins play at the cell membrane Chemistry Review: Elements, Atoms, Ions Molecules: Salts and water The cell as a factory Extracellular fluid separate neurons and glia from being tightly packed together Intracellular fluid is found inside a cell The most important factor governing the flow of substances into and out of the cell is the cell membrane’ s semipermeability (ensures concentrations of substances inside and outside the wall are different) Nuclear membrane: Protective shell that surrounds the nucleus Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) The “factory floor”, that copied genetic blueprints are sent to from the nucleus Microfilaments and Neurofilaments: Reinforce the cells structure, giving it shape but also allowing it to change shape + function throughout its life Microtubules: Form the transportation network that carries proteins to their destinations Constructed of proteins that have globular structure and are positively charge on one end and negatively charged on the other, which enables components to link together and form scaffolds or tracks TBI + Concussion can cause symptoms associated with the malfunction of brain transport systems Lysosomes: Cehicles that transport incoming nutrients and remove and store waste Mitochondrial diseases (genetic in origin) result in symptoms that include chronic fatigue: Primary mitochondrial diseases: Genetic conditions in which mitochondria in one or more body organs fail to produce enough energy to carry out normal function Secondary mitochondrial disease: Occurs in association with other diseases (incl Alzheimer’s diabetes, and cancer) Cell membrane: barrier and gatekeeper The cell membrane separates the intracellular fluid from the extracellular fluid Iff too muhc water enters a cell, it will burst If too much water leaves a cell, it will shrivel The structure of the cell helps ensure that neither of these events happen: A: double layered cell membrane close up B: detail of a phospholipid molecule’s polar head and electrically neutral tails C: Space filling model shows why the phosphate’s head polar regions (positive and negative poles) are hydrophilic, whereas its nonpolar fatty acid tail is hydrophobic Similarly to water molecules, lipids(fat moecules) also have a positive charge in one location and a negative charge in another The head has a polar electrical charge, with a positive charge in one location and a negative charge in another The tails consist of hydrogen and carbon atoms that tightly bind to one another by shared electrons ( the fatty tail has no polar regions)l Hydrophilia (from the greek hydro = “water”, philia = “love”) Hydrophobia (from the greek hydro = “water”, philia = “fear”) The head of a phospholipid loves water and the tails hate it To avoid water, the tails of molecules point toward each other The heads align with each other and point outward to the intra/extracellular fluid As a result, the cell membrane consists of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules: The cell membrane is impenetrable to intracellular and extracellular water because polar water molecules cannot pass through the hydrophobic tails on the membrane’s interior The nucleus and protein synthesis Genes: DNA segment that encodes the synthesis of a particular protein Chromosomes: Double helix structures that hold an organism’s entire DNA library Nucleotide bases: The consistent molecules of the genetic code: adenine (A), thiamine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) Adenine always pairs with Thiamine Guanine always pairs with Cytosine A gene is a segment of a DNA strand, and a gene’s code is its sequence of thousands of nucleotide bases The sequence of ACTG base pairs spells out the order in which amino acids (the consistent molecules of proteins ) should be assembled to construct a certain protein Each gene has, on average, approximately 30,000 base pairs The human genome contains about 3 billion base pairs How genes make proteins — Transcription: Appropriate segment of the DNA strand unwinds to expose a gene (sequence of nucleotide bases that encode a protein) The exposed sequence of nucleotide bases attracts free-floating molecules called nucleotides — one strand of DNA serves as a template for transcribing a molecule of mRNA The mRNA leaves the nucleus and comes into contact with ribosomes in the endoplasmic reticulum As a ribosome moves along the mRNA, it translates the bases (gene) into a specific amino acid chain, which forms the protein Endoplasmic reticulum and protein manufacture RNA vs DNA When RNA is produced through transcription, it forms a chain of bases similar to a strans of DNA — so what makes it different Instead of thiamine, the base uracil ( U) attaches to adenine Other than this, the base codes of RNA and DNA are similar mRNA (messenger ribonucleuc acid): The transcribed strand of RNA that carriers the protein out of the nucleus into the endoplasmic reticulum Ribosomes: Protein structures that act as catalysts for the formation of proteins When an mRNA molecule reaches the ER, it passes through a ribosome where its genetic code is read Transfer RNA (tRNA): Assists in the process of translating se4quences of nucleotide bases in the mRNA into particular sequences of amino acids in a process known as translation Codons: Sequence of three nucleotides chich together form a unit of genetic code in a DNA or RNA molecule Uracil, guanine, guanine (UGG) encodes the amino acid tyyptophen (Trp) Uracil, uracil, uracil (UUU ) encodes the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) Structure of an amino acid Each amino acid consists of a central carbon atom (C) The carbon atom is bound to A hydrogen atom (h) An amino acid group (NH 3+ ) A carboxyl group (COO – ) And a side chain (represented by the letter R The side chain varies in chemical composition from one amino acid to another Each amino acid group is bound to the carboxyl group of the adjacent amino acid by a peptide bond This is why amino acid chains are referred to as polypeptide chains GENERAL SEQUENCE: DNA → mRNA → Protein Proteins and RNA: the cell’s products Protein: Folded up polypeptide chain that serves a particular function in the body Heleces (spirals): Pleated sheets that fold together; made from long polypeptide chains that twist together Whether a polypeptide chain forms a pleated sheet or helix, and what it’s 3D shape will ultimately be are determined by the amino acid sequence in the primary structure Misfolded proteins: Our cells have mechanisms to ensure proteins are correctly pleated + folded Misfolded proteins are implicated in more than 100 nervous system diseases Prions: Misfolded proteins that cause other proteins to misfold; implicated in many degenerative brain diseases Noncoding RNA (ncRNA): RNAs involved in gene translation, and are thus not themselves translated into proteins Although each gene codes for one protein, a protein can be cleaved into pieces through other mechanisms to form two or more proteins or combine to form other proteins Proteins themselves can also modify other proteins, acting as enzymes Enzymes: Proteins that enhance chemical reactions Golgi bodies and microtubules: protein packaging and shipment Exporting a protein entails packaging, transporting, and assigning its fate at the destination If a protein is destined to remain within the cell, it is inloaded into the intracellular fluid If a protein is to be incorporated into the cell membrane, it is carried out to the membrane where it inserts itself If a protein is to be transported from the cell), it is transferred out (in a process called exocytosis: When the membrane (vesicle) in which the protein is wrapped fuses with the cell membrane, and the protein is excreted into the extracellular fluid Crossing the cell membrane: channels, gates, and pumps 3 types of membrane proteins — channels, gates, and pumps — perform the transport function The particular protein’s function is an emergent property of its shape A protein’s shape and ability to change shape derive from the precise amino acid sequence that composes the protein molecule Some change when others bind to them Some change when as a function of temperature Some change in response to changes in electrical charge Channels: Opening in a protein embedded in the cell membrane that allows the passage of ions Gate: Protein embedded in a cell membrane that allows for substances to pass through the membrane on some occasions but not others Changes in a protein’s shape allow it to act as a Pump: Protein in the cell membrane that actively transports a substance across the membrane 3-3 Genes, Cells, and Behaviour LOQ: Explain how allele combinations can influence physical and behavioural traits, and how genetic mutations can be acquired across an individual’s lifetime Describe the role of dominant and recessive alleles in diseases like Tay-Sachs and Huntington disease and in chromosomal abnormalities Describe several techniques for genetic modification Explain how epigenetic mechanisms influence the expression of our genetic code Mendelian genetics and the genetic code The nucleus of each human somatic cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 individual) One member of each pair comes from the mother, the other from the father Chromosome pairs are numbered from 1 to 23, with 1 being the largest Pairs 1 through 22 are called autosomes Chromosomes that contain the genes that contribute to our physical appearance and behaviour The 23rd pair consists of sex chromosomes The two mammalian sex chromosomes are X and Y Female mammals have 2 X chromosomes Male mammals have an X and a Y chromosome The Y chromosome contains the SRY (sex-determining region) that makes the sex determining region Y (SRY) protein, triggering testes development (and thus, the male phenotype) Each cell contains two copies of every gene (one from the mother and the one from the father) called Alleles: Alternative form of a gene; a gene pair contains two alleles Note: matched genes aren’t always identical: Homozygous Having two identical alleles for a trait Heterozygous Having two different alleles for the same trait Wild-type (frequently occurring): The nucleotide sequence most common in a population Mutation (infrequently occurring): Any alteration of a gene that yields a different version of its protein Dominant and recessive alleles If two alleles are homozygous, they encode the same protein If two alleles are heterozygous, one of three things could happen: Only the allele from the mother may be expressed Only the allele from the father may be expressed Both alleles may be expressed simultaneously ( creating a different protein) Dominant allele: A member of a gene pair that is routinely expressed as a trait Recessive allele: An unexpressed (but still present) allele Levels of Dominance: Complete dominance: Only the allele’s own trait is expressed in the phenotype Incomplete dominance: The alleles own trait is expressed only partially Codominance: Both the allele’s own trait and the trait of the other allele in the gene pair are expressed completely What needs to happen for a recessive trait to be expressed When paired with a dominant allele, a recessive allele is usually not expressed It can still be passed on, and thus influence future generations + expressed when not masked by the influence of a dominant trait Patterns of hair color illustrate how combinations of many alleles expressed in homo/heterozygous combinations ]= Genetic mutations The mechanism (3-2) for reproducing genes is fallible (prone to error) Errors can arise in the nucleotide sequence when reproductive cells make gene copies — these errors are called mutations Degrees of mutations Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; pronounced ‘snip’) A change in a single nucleotide base, resulting in a change in a codon and a resulting change in one amino acid in a protein Because the average gene has thousands of nucleotide bases, a huge number of SNPs can occur on a single gene Example - BRCA1 (BReast CAncer) gene Found on chromosome 17 A caretaker gene that contributes to preventing breast cancer and other cancers in both men and women Over 1000 mutations of this gene have been found Thus, in principle, there are more than 1000 ways in which to have a predisposition to, or increased resistance to, a cancer JUST from THIS gene Whether a mutation is beneficial or disruptive (or both): A SNP in which a T base is substituted for an A base in the HBB ( hemoglobin) gene on chromosome 11 causes sickle cell anemia Benefits: The sickle shape of blood cells offers some protection against malaria Disruptions: Sickle cells have poor oxygen carrying capacity, which weakens the person who possesses them Acquired genetic mutations While some genetic mutations (like the ones above) can be inherited by offspring from parents, others occur throughout life By 80 years of age, a neuron might have up to 2000 mutations (times 173 billion) Genosenium: The analysis of DNA changes in the aging brain Applying Mendel’s principles Allele disorders that affect the brain Tay-Sachs disease: Inherited birth defect caused by the loss of genes that encode the enzyme necessary for breaking down certain fatty substances; appears 4-6 months after birth and results in intelectual disability, physical changes, and death by about age 5 More common in Ashkenazi Jews + French Canadians Cause of Tay-Sachs: The dysfunctional Tay-Sachs HexA enzyme is c aused by a recessive (nonfunctioning) allele of the HEXA gene on chromosome 15 Two copies of the nonfunctional allele are needed for the disorder to manifest (both parents must have the gene) Wild type: Both parents would posess a corresponding dominant wild type HEXA allele for that particular gene pair Which allele is passed on (the dominant [healthy - wild type] or recessive [unhealthy - Tay-Sachs]) is completely up to chance The Tay-Sachs allele operates independently of the dominant allele Thus it still produces the defective HexA enzyme, so the person who carried it has a higher than normal lipid accumulation in the brain BUT, because this person has a normal allele that produces a functional enzyme, the abnormal accumulation is not enough to cause the disease Blood tests can detect whether a person carriers the Tay-Sachs allele — which can inform decisions about conception Inheritance Patterns: Carrier + Carrier = Chance of having two normal alleles = 25% Chance of contracting the disease = 25% Chance of being a carrier is 50% Carrier + Noncarrier 50% probability of having normal genes 50% probability of being a carrier 0% probability of developing the disease Huntington disease: Hereditary disease characterised by chorea (creaseless involuntary jerky movements) and progressive dementia, ending in death Symptoms can begin at any point in life, but typically begin around midlife and include involuntary movements ( chorea = greek for ‘dance’) The buildup of an abnormal version of the huntington protein kills the brain cells of the basal ganglia and neocortex Importance of studying huntington’s in Neuroscience: Research into the condition has revealed a lot about the relationship between a single gene and the nervous system More importantly, this knowledge may lead to a cure Inheritance patterns: Huntington’s disease is caused by a dominant gene — only one copy is needed to cause the condition to express Carrier + Carrier 75% chance of developing the disease 25% chance of not developing the disease Carrier + Noncarrier 50% chance of developing the disease 50% chance of not developing the disease Chromosome abnormalities Down syndrome Chromosomal abnormality resulting in intellectual impairment and other abnormalities, usually caused by an extra chromosome 21 (trisonomy) Genetic Engineering Selective breeding The oldest means of influencing genetic traits in animals and plants Began with the domestication of wolves into dogs over 30,000 years ago Effect on the brain; from wolves → dogs A dog’s brain is smaller than a wolf’s brain Dog’s brains ( converselly) have the largest number of cortical neurons for a carnivore of its size (may account for level of sociability with humans) Variability as a benefit Selective breeding has produced the species with the most diverse traits of all animal species (can run fast, haul heavily loads, retrieve prey, dig, climb, herd, and cuddle) Maintaining spontaneous mutations is a critical objective Researchers can produce whole populations of animals possessing some unusual trait that originally arose as an unexpected mutation in one or a few individuals Cloning Other methods of manipulating gene expression include altering early embryonic development. Cloning Producing an offspring that is genetically identical to another animal How to clone: A cell nucleus that contains DNA is placed in an egg cell from which the nucleus has been removed Then stimulate the egg to start dividing Then the embryo is implanted into the uterus of a female ( cloning method called nuclear transfer) Each animal that develops from these cells is genetically identical to the donor — thus this method can be used to: Preserve valuable traits Study the relative influences of heredity and environment Produce new tissue or organs for transplant to the donor Deextinction: A prospective technique that uses genetic engineering that seeks to revive extinct species using preserved cells from frozen carcasses of extinct animals or animals closely related to an extinct animal Transgenic techniques Transgenic animals: Product of technology in which one or more genes from one species is introduced into the genome of another species to be passed along and expressed in subsequent generations The epigenetic code Applying the epigenetic code CHAPTER 4 How Do Neurons Use Electrical Signals to Transmit Information?
