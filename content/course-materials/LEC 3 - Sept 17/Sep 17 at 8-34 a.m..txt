Our heart. These are driven by those low-level range downtime circus. There's still no circuit lead controlled the neural circuits that tell us when to go to sleep or to eat, you know. The hypothalamus went to drain. That were essentially automatized to our brain circuits. That's where we are. Um.

How long does it take? You talk a little bit about personal context. Last time. How long does it take for that to come? Like the last lobe of the brain, but how long does it take? When is it fully development around 20 yeah 25 percent? Yeah, yeah, I don't know if anyone ever said the actual number, but they say in the 20s, yeah, late 18 and early 20s.

Um, for you to understand the reasoning and higher functions, and you all know this as the other people reporting from the University. But these circuits are particularly developing, and it's the last circuits that sort of get laid down in the brain. After 25, can you learn anything so? Of course, you.

I'm stupid enough to learn snowboarding. Um, 2017, so I was like in my 40s. And I took my four kids and we all bought snowboards, right? We're learning. Right. And then, last year, I decided to. This is like, from my Parkinson's experiences, from my people who I dance with.

They push their reins, and I'm like, why shouldn't I push my brain as a 4-year-old, because I know my brain is starting to shrink? Right? So, at 20, in the 20s, your brain is fully developed as a person, and you push your brain. And you're going to develop that.

Don't push your breath. Those circuits are not that itself. Right, and so people who have dementia. Or develop myopogative impairment as they're older. Are people who are pushing their right? Right. And, and maybe they're in a like, I was a machinist at high school at a university. The machine has the same bloody thing like continuously the whole day.

I mean, cuz I haven't been doing this since I was 17, but I remember doing it right, like now, probably 20 000 times every week. So there's been there like that, you know, you don't want to work like this?

And so this is a good example of a part, and so the auto part would be. Do you guys know anything about the circulatory system of cause?

You don't have a circulatory system in your car. What happens?

So, you need to cool it just like a rings. We talk about the venture pose. Vegetables in the brain lead to nourish and and doesn't do really temperature a little bit. It does. That has to circulate around the brain to bathe it and nourish it and take away the garbage from the car.

When it's too hot, it'll seize, and the parts will break, and you'll break your cylinder head. So there's a part like this that is part of the coolant system has a hose attaches to it. It has to do machine perfectly so that the hose fits in. Right, so these products that came from another part in Factory or from another Factory?

Hit a button. Get another brain, lift it off and dump it in and do thousands of the times. So the first, like half an hour of my? Life as a machinist that I would like all. Holy shit! I don't want to do that. I like those weren't there. My family, like, works in that kind of stuff.

As a kid, immigrants from India. And, and so this is the jobs they got, and that is exactly work, not a doctor work pressure marker. You work that Firestone as well likely. Right. That kind of job and career path from the 70s and '80s doesn't existence. That you all know about?

Now, but yeah, I kind of didn't exist. 20 or 30 years now. Right. First, kind of movies I talked about over Asians, destroy it like terminal.

And that's an AI. Right, so? So? I don't even know where I went. Why? I told you about this.

Yeah, I got some circuits right circuits in it and stuff. So, this circuit that I trained within, like, maybe half an hour to an hour. I did this in. Somewhere between 1989-19. Right? So that's like, it's a long time ago, 45 years ago, and I still remember it as if it was like yesterday.

Okay, remember the red button to push? Like, I remember the smell. Of the forklifts that are burning cocaine. Okay, push it out. Like, I remember these things, so your brains do in a circuit, and sometimes it doesn't. In a maladaptive way to deal with that word means. So, malino is something that it does, and it keeps it, but it doesn't help your behavior in the future.

It may like actually harm your own future. Right. So, one example of a harm or a maladaptive thing. Now, that is, like circuit or rain. Um, happen. What would be an example of that? What's maladapted to our behavior? Be a person in society and whatever you want to do.

Right? You all live in Toronto, but what else should?

Yeah, even well for sure. Most of those people having problems yesterday.

So, these are validuction circuits that happen somehow. And we don't know why, so I'm going to tell you today a little bit about circus. Probably, this is the only class. That I'll never can't really talk about Americans, which is okay. Uh, it's super cool positive to me and it, like, bathed my head.

It makes all time. But today, we'll talk a little bit about. Um, circuits, a little bit about neurons. And I think what I might want to do at the starter classes together. You guys wake up. Is, do you kind of like, you know, the quiz that you would have done, like last week, and you did do?

And then you got into the groups? I'd like you guys to get into the groups. I'll give you something I brought some green paper, and I'll pass it around, and so once you get the groups I want you guys to do the same thing as you do for a quiz, but in only send me one paper at the end of class.

Or any, anytime, and what I want you to do is. Draw like a circuit? As best you can in your group, and you can cheat like, look at the box below. It's like anywhere, and describe like a certain kind of at least three neurons. Right and and tell me about it.

Just grab one for your group and then pass them on. And I want you to describe a neural circuit as best you can. Uh, pass those to the back. And getting your groups, and so on. One side of the page is gayburn, what your name, issue number between improvements, and you're, like, yeah, you're like, Daniel, like, yeah, I agree.

As well as, hey, I find a group, and, uh, what. A circuit is a circuit circus. Hi, I'm dear. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

Um, so three neurons, I mean, like? It's like you would have like a, for example, like, you know? I sent like a, you know, a sensory neuron relays like to a like a neural circuit in the brain that then you know, would relay back to like a motor neuron to, like, facilitate movement.

I mean, I guess we can try and draw that circuit. Yeah, showing a good one would be like. What you just said, I feel like it goes to the brain and gets processed. Like, maybe a visual thing, like looking at a laptop. Yeah, then you recognize it's a laptop, and that's like the relay, and then you.

Do motor, and like, type it down. Maybe something like that? What I'm just wondering is like, how, like how the information is processed in the brain to, like, then, like, you know, relay the motor output? Yeah, yeah, it goes into, like, gray matter, like the outer cortex, and then from there, I don't know.

It goes into the frontal lobe, and then it eventually goes back, but it all happens like in the CNS. Sensory neurons collect apparent information from the body. So, yeah, sensory neurons collect the information from the body. They connect it to intern neurons. Those are the neurons like that. Those are in the brain, and then they pass it on to the motor neurons that then facilitate the movement.

Yeah, so that's two neuros. So all those interneurons that's well, so sensory, inter inter, and then motor and motor. Yeah, but the interneurons are like, where all the integration happens. And that's, like, you're thinking and all that like that. It would be like. Sensory. A little longer. Then you kind of go like that, right?

Yeah, yeah. Is there any other like more? To it there definitely is. I mean, I was gonna say, like, do we need to get artistic about it? Yeah, I'm gonna need to draw the synopsis and all that. I can draw, but not neurons. Here's what I was thinking, maybe, like?

Maybe you can draw the connection of like the axon to the next axon terminal or something like that? How are you feeling? Oh, I'm cooked. I'm so cooked. No matter how much our dealings I feel like they're just, I was the first two lectures in this class. I just joined, so honestly, they were really dense.

They were dead. Yeah, I enjoyed the material, but it's, it's a lot. How great I would do, the learnings I'm doing both, but I'm really just focusing on like characters how much I should focus on this shit. Okay, yeah, but I would get that overview again somewhere, you know, references.

You need to look at it like this. It was an experiment, like in the textbooks that I'm like, okay. Other than that, it's quite a bit. I'm not really, unless it's like related to Arkansas. There were a few. Maybe drawing, like going through the eyes, like the visual signal, yeah, and?

It goes to like? The except a lobe and then gets integrated, and then you use your hands to type the motor. I don't know how to draw that. I'm not an artist. I'm trying to conceptualize that and just seems so complicated. I'm just trying to find the chapter on like, information consolidation.

Did you go through the entire textbook? Yep.

Which I didn't like record the entire time.

He made the dots on his eyes hard.

Describe a neural circuit. Maybe you can draw like a little? Yeah, there we go. No, no, like that. I honestly looks like the textbook. Like, I see what you're going for. Yeah, this was your laptop. And then, should we like, these are sensory centers? The thing is like, you could just go on like so many different levels like you could talk about.

Like, you know, the like, release of like neurotransmitters across the like, accidental log, and you can, like, like, how, like, detailed, do we want to be? I just, I don't even know where to start. I think you know what, though, that's just a symptom of knowing a lot of information is.

I don't know what I don't know because I haven't looked at the entire textbook. That's fair. Yeah. Just trying to draw a brain. Have you been here for all the lectures? Yeah. How are you feeling about it? It's interesting. It's cool, absolutely. Yeah, I think I need to focus more on the things you should focus a lot.

I feel like all the exams are going to be faced. Now, the way that I do, the textbook is all like. I'll do like chapter headers, and for all of the headers, I'll just go and copy them down, so I have a general idea of like the structure of the chapter, then I'll go through and I'll copy the keywords that are like listed and bold and underlined anything that's like, italicized, and seems important.

And then, once I have that, I basically have, like, you know, that's a good thing about achieve is that they do that already. Yeah, like, rot, sort of rough, like textbook notes, that I can then just sort of go and like, skim through and read through it. And that's, you know, some sort of supplement and augment that with like details if it needs to be explained forever?

I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Oh, my name is, uh, awesome, Adam, um. That's fair. I, I remember you. It's just the name. So, Jays, yeah, um, do you want to join our Discord group? Oh, you have a group for this class. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you too, sorry.

Oh, I don't know, um? There that I was talking to, and some of them figured out to add you guys.

Str. Ridiculous fucking, Romanian monster, you're Romania, I'm I'm a mod. Man, I'm so many different things. Oh, for now.

Yeah, exactly. I'm sorry if one of your last names was Williams or Smith.

What's your last name, huh? Coconuts, my last name's almost?

I'm Pakistani by the way. Pakistani, yeah, I was born. Yeah, I was born in India, India. Okay. Okay, out of here. Okay.

Igles. Here, but both my parents are from Ukraine. Oh yeah. Yeah, I was also born here, but. I was born in Ohio, Ohio. I got some cousins in Ohio, it's so funny. Oh yeah, they're like, how'd they end up there? And they just came from Parks from last year.

Oh yes, I'm great and. They went to Ohio because that was, like, the only place they could find jobs. Yeah, where it's more affordable for them here. They hate it there because it's Ohio, yeah, it's like, and I think, like, also, I mean whereabouts in Ohio, are they Springfield is, yeah?

Are you? Are you guys both in Psych? Yeah, I'm in Psychology. How about you guys? Yeah, okay, thank you all she should have received from them. Yeah, I switched. I was doing undergraduate that is hard to do that in Ireland. Yeah, you can do straight out of high school in Europe.

Like, oh yeah, so I did that for three years. I was thinking about having a psychiatry, but you know, like, for all pogstones, I guess you know, uh, when you do medicine, it's not your choice. Like, yeah, you know. What's as funny about that, cuz my brother's a doctor.

And he did the same thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two minutes, three minutes, three minutes. Okay. You can spend the rest of the course just answering this question because people do this for their whole careers, right? So, I guess, I think that's that. William is the point that, like, it's just so convoluted, and there's so many different laws to it that more interesting is specialize in research, it appears, and so it's better than look at the laptop than you think about whatever the hell you're going to type or whatever you're looking on the laptop.

Maybe you're on E class or whatever the, that's the Eastern. And then it goes into the motor of neurons. Which are, you know, and then effectors? Yeah, that's a big SARS. Effector is, uh, the muscle itself. Okay, that does the effect, you know, the motor effect so? Like them.

Yeah, you need fingers like the motor neuron, like directs like, you know, for example, like this, this joint, which is like the effector to yeah, it's like the effector muscles like, okay, yeah, it's the effect, you know, because yeah, the cause and effect, right? Like, the cause is entering your eyes and all this, and that in effect.

Okay, yeah, I see. And then, that's a really easy laptop to draw. I could draw well, yeah, so if you look from the side enough, it looks just like that right angle. Yeah, I like it. Picasso, yeah, my art teachers. Interneurons are the reason. Yeah. But usually, what we learned, like when we're learning, like the reflex Arc.

But, you know, when we're learning about the reflex spark or whatever it's called, you know, the the reflected statement? Oh yeah, like with the um, the knees. Yeah, yeah, but like, and yeah, it can be anything like heat like that. It's really simple because it just goes to your spinal cord, because that's way quicker.

So that's why they just show that one and relay on your own, but usually like. This question was decided specifically. I don't know. I just that's exactly. Okay, this would be the synapse, right. Like the space in between, you have, like, whatever is in between, like this, you have, like, sign ups should be there in there, and who knows, something like, accidental lock here, yeah?

Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of signups around the eyes.

It's, uh, is it? Motor neurons that have more dendritic spines? I don't feel so bad, I think more information. So for? With other crewsbury, Texas. Um, so I'm just. I just turned into, like, I. I've like taken Twitter courses in my first two years, and I think I'm more like a trivia for you guys, but um, I'm finishing my my only I, but IGA semester, yeah, uh.

First class stats to bring your robots. Hey Max Anatomy? Yes, they gave me like 39 elective credits. I think I can be finished by next year. Look after my third year, but I want to go into like Master's PhD in a while. What do you plan to do? I definitely.

I want to pursue sex. I have to give a faster. I'm not sure. It's like, yeah, it's a lot. It is a lot like, it's crazy, you know how it's going crazy? Yeah, yeah, I was thinking. It's just like where your ride is. The easiest thing to think about, yeah, but I don't know when I just ended up feeling.

Another Masters. Yeah. Like, right now, I'm thinking about doing clinical psychology. I don't know, exactly like, could not have any neuropsychology. Like, I'm almost. Yeah, we both want to do neurosaic. Yeah, like I'm I really wanted to get very good signs to maybe do research their. Sounds like we all are sort of like similar.

I think it. Just let my parents feel like I'm gonna do for them like this, but as long as they're willing to do, that's probably why they went so hard. I guess your parents are hard for Christmas. Yeah, that's what they want is okay, um, but?

It was in the University College Court. That's like near the south of Portland. It's like three hours enough heavy accidents, but they're really nice people, way nicer than Canadians. They're actually, you know, nice. They're not just San Francisco. Yeah, play. You know, kind? Yeah, they're actually, really good, probably because they drink a lot.

Grow is drunk, like, hey, let's hug, yeah, uh, uh. Like a teenage girl. It's awesome. The student accommodation is so much better than they're. Like, so highly established. I'd say I've been wanting to go there. Yeah, where is this? I'm talking about, like Europe, in general, like UK as well, like, uh, what else, cuz we have like a deal with the EU, right, like Canada, like you can go.

And yeah, that's how, like, there's this thing called Atlantic Bridge. That's like the sponsored Canadians in Ireland, specifically, and then come back up okay. Are probably gone. Yeah, should we just like the washroom? Here is really weird floor. Yeah, I thought it was going to say something else. There is one on the second.

As well, but like, really great. I used to go years.

All right. So, uh, anyone want to volunteers what the basic like? But their Discovery is in your group.

I know, I'm saying anymore, all right. Yeah, go ahead. I mean, I kind of reveal the research, but I think like, Mr Monroe, so it could kind of just like find that work of neurons that passed a message. But like, why we're on to the other because? You know, transmit messages.

That's the reason why people to move my help with my ends, yes. That's super great! Example and a description of it, anyone know the most basic neural survey you could describe to your like parents? Yeah. Would it be the nature reflex? Yeah. Spinal cord behind your arms and then back to the motor neurons and the effector.

Yeah, so it's like, here is this ligament or tendon. Has a detector protected light? And because it gets hit by a little Hammer. Which I probably can't do myself, but. Actually, let's go and, and so that that. The length of it changes the firing rate that's based, so imagine.

Imagine. You have this muscle, and we have a tendon there. And it sends signal that is the smile board. Into the spinal cord, synaxis. Send something to the muscle. And when the length changes. So, the fire rate might be so at level a where there's no change. The base fire can rate might be like four spikes per like.

Second. But when it gets stretched with a hammer. Looks like Tom Hawkings. Right, the fireman might go from. This is a my Baseline.

Like, always terrible. Right, and B the power might be. Right? And the action potentials travel down this. Synapse here make this one higher and make this contract and change the length. How fast do you think that happens if anyone's just felt that in their life? Does it take me?

And for how long does it take? Or the bounce of the leg. Once the hammer in? Should be a couple milliseconds because it's through electrical circuit, and it doesn't even go through your brain. It just goes through your spinal cord. Yeah, so this, so this, uh, I'm going to draw this bigger?

All right, so this is a neuron and where you see this in the examples today, right, and the traveling once? This video is a threshold. There's an actual potential that happened. We're going to describe this the next few weeks, and it travels along this. And this takes a few milliseconds, so two to four five milliseconds.

And there's a thousand milliseconds in a second, so it's super fast. Super quick has to be super fast. So quick. When people are older, like this man developing Parkinson's disease? These circuits. So, if he has the next circuit coming back? These circuits get a little slower because age or disease, and then people fall.

Right. The worst thing is an older person. I know 28ch like 70s or 80s to fall and break ahead. Prognosis of? Life after one year is burial. All right, so your grandmother or somebody you have to take care of them is really like, make sure they're mentally. They're sitting in the hospital for like a month.

That's disaster for? So, so this is kind of the circuit. That's the knee-jerk reflex, which is a great example. It's a little hard to do, and sometimes if you're saying, hey, uh, Dad, sit there. And I'm going to hit your thing. And I'm going to make a goal, but if you don't have to still to do it.

Then, it's kind of unveiled, like, experiment that you look like, oh, I'm like, no, but cool. It's really dead. I didn't keep getting super easy to describe, so that's one example. It's a great one. It's in the book. It's in my notes. Um, they even have another example. Yeah, I guess you better want to be to touch a really hot stove.

Yeah. So, uh, touching a hot skull, and what happens if you touch your hot stove? Or whatever effects there is, like, melting, right. Because these reflexes are there the nature. The withdrawal reflex. All these reflexes are there to save new residue from being, say your apparatus or Superman, right?

Not making a job, right? It's the basic behavior of every form. Yeah, knock knock. Which is a behavior? Right, so? But it's kind of an umbrella game. Out of any other examples in your groups or anything. So, I'm going to teach you why. Today, it's super simple. It's reader.

Does anyone know what to be neuron are? Google search. It so? We are super simple. I have a feeling I showed you a bit of this, so if you look at the finger and you move her head, can you do this the class? Everyone look at the fingerprints on any finger and just wiggle your head around like you're moving it.

If you were on like one of those ballable like heads? On the car, right? And can you still see your fingerprint the whole time?

Right. So, so you know the rate, you move your finger or your head. Now, move your finger the same way. Do you see your fingerprint? Right. It's still you, like, you see your favorite brand name for Tanger at the same rate, right, same velocity still, your brain doing it right.

So, why do you think there's no problems? Why can't you see your finger in like this? Why you can't see the finger? Yeah, is there? Like, my name Jay is there. There's like, maybe something like going on in the brain. That's like allowing us to like, sort of, compensate for that movement and allow us to.

To like, uh, like, retain the picture? Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Yeah, um, any other comments or questions? Or point, so the this one where you're moving your head. You're looking at a fingerprint or anything detailed, like when you're on your phone and you're watching. Right? If you're 80, you're not going to be able to do that.

Right, because you're probably going to walk into a bang or fall or it hurts, right? Even if you train for 60 years, you guys are in your 20s or maybe 30s, but there's one of these if you train for 50 years. Doing this walking with your phone? Right, it's not going to help you when you're eight, because these reflexes slow down.

Right, you're not going to boost your like skill set doing this. The stimulator, author of the reflex. We're going to not talk about their distribution system at all in this class, but it's a system of organs that is designed to keep your head. And eyes specifically on target. For deviations of head body, whatever in a car wherever, and it's between our owns.

That's it! The end neuron is just like the nature, and instead of going to the muscles here. It's going to the muscles around your eyes. Sorry. A condition. I forgot the name of, but any moving objects. Become invisible for them. Like anything, that's moving whatsoever. They cannot say that can start to bump into them, but once it's not moving, then they can't see it.

But if, like, you throw a ball, they won't see it until they stops moving until it lines, like, is it? Yeah, uh. A nice name. So, where are you crazy man, uh? I think it was. This is probably the 90s, but I think it was. Rhl. That's all. And I think it's like 19.

Something around the 90s, and in this case this patient, so I'm going to draw my brains. My brains are terrible. Oh, this is the, so we learned a little bit about orientation. So, this is the left lateral view of my brain. Of course, terrifly cartoon, right, and, and this is the back of the brain where the acceptable and visual cortex is.

And this is the parts of the brain head matures. These circuits mature over. 20 something years, right? And so there's an area of the frame. We're going to talk about a little bit, except at all. And it's centered here. And there's one on the other side. The other side of the brain.

And it's called area Mt. Video temporal. And yes. Receive signals. From the local process to many synapses. And its main job is to decode motion. And so this, this group. Here again, that's a positive thing, but I know it personally. Something like that probably did not, right? Maybe it was weird, and he's part of that paper and.

This person had a legion. Okay on the left or right side. I don't remember that. Because I read this like decades ago, and that person, if we were like. Say they were walking around, and they're come to a street. The cars that drive by they don't see the motion.

They just stop action. Right? And especially One Direction, but I don't remember which direction it was, and that's exactly what you just tried. Yeah, it's super rare. Like, I've only seen two or one or two papers on it in my life, right? Because the person has to have a stroke or some sort of damage and takes out a super small circuit.

This may be the size of. Sweet, and by 10 millimeters like, it's super small. Yeah, and they're like, right adjacent to it here. There's an area called MST, which then codes Direction, so this codes directional movement so. A little bit going simili moving this way or this way. And you can see where I'm going.

This way or this way. I'm stimulated Arts or balls or stuff, and then this is very empty. We're going way too deep here. Sorry, it's just fine. And NST then puts us together into Optical packs. So expanding, so imagine, like if you put your space over to the stars that are coming towards you, that could be Xfinity and then contract.

And otherwise. And so he's sensing up to be, but because that's damaged a person sees no woman, right? And it's super crazy. It's not a reflex. It's, it's part of this circuit that we're talking about, like the new artist for me to walk and say things and not. Lose track of where they are.

Yep, the reflex fix that. That's three neurons. To get to Mt and MST, you have. From the eyeball. The back of the red nut synapse to an area probably here. In the balance. A lot of genocide. Then synonym, accept it all, and then multiple synapses to other places to decode, like form and objects and direction of emotion and color.

And that's way too many neurons to keep track of. Like, when you're shaking your hand. Right, the same speed you move your head, because it's more than three knots. It could be like 20 year olds or 40 neurons, and so in the three neuron Arc, the VOR. Has three neurons, one in terms of vestibular.

After we got the concealer outrides, the settings are doing now's. I'd like to enter our audit really, and then once the muscles in the eyes. Three neurons, and if each one has a delay of two to five milliseconds. You're somewhere on the order of four to 10 milliseconds away.

And you guys all know what delay is? Maybe not because you're younger than me, but when I was a kid? He didn't have it here at all. Right, we're supposed to stay in cell phones. And. That started to happen. We had a thing called dial-up with the hard one.

And it had this handshaking thing, and the delays were super slow. Right, like, super crazy stuff. You could never watch a movie on. The guy left three or four. Right. And that's because the delays were so low, like, so high, right? Like this? You had no, like, refresh rate really quick.

Right? So that's kind of the analogy you have, like old school stuff, which is like the cortical stuff and you have these reflexes in your brain stem. Right, and this is actually not investigated to your brainstem. But it's super fast. So does this help like, and so this is a circuit.

This is a behavior. There's nibular ocular reflections of behavior we all need is don't have. It can't like walk to school. You can't really do anything. Maybe a disaster, and so I'll show you an example. I wasn't gonna now because we went down this path. It's kind of cool.

Okay, so this person. So this person to zoom in of? I plan to call a person that's negatively who is? Uh, getting the wrong homologist. Somewhere Baltimore, like a John Hopkin, and he's written a whole bunch of books. Clinical books on, I believe, that's the stuff super cool, so.

I told you we were fucking around needing an egg. You were just fingerprint, even if there's a problem within the singular system. Your eyes will move without you walking. Right, so? This neuron sends out a signal over here, had rotates. Right. Connect to that travel. It drops down and cracks.

If this thing has a virus or something like that or a tumor pressing on it? It's going to change the vibrate. This area, your eyes move, even though you don't want it. Right. So that's what I'm going to show you now. A disruption in this Twitter on heart, but only on one side of the right.

And this poor lady. Sure. Can you see that on the screen there, like? Your eyes are kind of like beating.

And it usually happens when a person's in the periphery. So the person's probably looking at the neurologist fingers? So, what the person would perceive? Like, because this is your high experienced this once. For the virus that I mentioned. Um, a person would perceive the world generate at the rate that their head is.

So they would see the whole world. It's like you grabbing like a paper drop, but it's like you grabbing your screen and wiggling it the same rate as your head. Because. The apparatus revision is in the eye. And normally everything's corrected for it, right? So, in this case, it's not corrected.

So, this person has perception of movement of the world, which makes her dizzy and is called vertigo or whatever disease it is. And it's called well. This in this case is called word of these games and settings. But you see that meaning, right? And this is a disturbance on her in her neural circuits.

So does this make sense? It's a useful exercise. We did so far today. Before we like, dive into like, Electrifice something. I think I think it's super important to like, have you think about the problems and think about it?

About certain things so?

Okay, so. This is probably the only thing I'll talk about apartments today. Was that the end of the dance class and we sit here? We stand in a circle and we say we're grateful to the teachers and the teachers like acknowledge this after the hour today. And then we almost hands, and we do something.

Right. And to me, it's like. But roll the hands and we kind of pass the pulse and kind of stay together. Something right with the attention to the day. That's cool. And I'm a lot of people I get, but I think it's a nice analogy of like connecting. Right, as a group socially, and it might have inequalities to it, I don't know, but.

So, these are the main names of the neuron. All memorization. Um, I didn't talk about one thing that's super important, right? So you got the the gang rights, the cell body, and the nucleus. And then you got. The spot here, which is the integration volition. Essentially, does math, and it computes.

The voltage across all the plants, and then it says yes or no. So, actually, every neuron is the decision maker. It makes a choice whether to send a signal off. Or nonsense. Right. So, what's an example say? This was part of a circuit in the brain. It, just learning had a problem, and it fired all the time.

What could happen in this poor person? I guess it was part of service two years. Yeah, it could spread it continually spread. Throughout the whole Reign because, like, contracting the muscles, make the person fall down. A couple years ago in this class. There's analogous class like this, but not this exact class.

And so she trained me to do what I want to do. Luckily, I never need to do it. She never had, um, like, I guess electricity and everything. Yeah, yeah, so that's the same thing. Yeah, and, and if we, if we have so around the point where it turns purple to Green in this picture?

This integration zone is the decision maker to say yes, I'm going to send a signal down. I'm going to open the gate. And once it gets to the end at the axon terminals, the signal that took two or three milliseconds depending on the length of a neuron. Um, what would happen at the end?

It synapses to something else. Yeah, like, usually a neuron. That's probably the most things that happen. It could be on a muscle like I drew here, my really bad muscle of an eye. Right, there is my bad muscle of my hamstring. Oh no, I didn't even draw it. Yeah, and so, um, you can have neuromuscular Junction synopsis.

You can have neuromodulators that modulate certain things you have many of these functions. Um, but the cool thing is. When this the synapse on the next Post and I'll pick what happened? Something that's released there. That's not electrical. What are our gap Junctions? So there are some neurons that actually electrical.

Pulse gets put to the second one without. Intermediate. So, what would be an intermediate to signal to the next one? You guys heard of neurotransmitters? Yes, okay, so neurotransmitters are chemicals. Right. So, so far, we only talked about electrical stuff. But at the end of that or the end of this or the end of this month, something gets released by his actual terminals.

And it's chemicals. Yeah, okay. Right, and so it's, it's cool. It's it's electrical, chemical pops, yeah. Yeah, so in in this case. And then in these cases, the sodium and potassium transfer along the pathway to make the pulse into a pulse somewhere. Make this pulse. So this pulse would be transmitted.

Say here and then the Venus, kind of like pointy here. And this 20 years old violence, right? So we have these things on here, and so whatever is regenerated here. And then extend this shape, and then it can be done faster. Right, but this part is the ion channels coming in and out.

Sodium, potassium. Um, jump in and out with a neuron, and we'll get into this, like next week, that we have here. But once you get to the end point here. Chemicals get released, like? Like acetylcholine or dopamine or other ones get released to that or glutamate.

Cause something to the action. Right, whatever it is neuron neurons to muscle. They're going to, like, hey right, there's some chemical that gets released, except in the gap Direction is super. Does this make sense, like? So, it's cool when you say it's electrical. But the electrical is then transferred to a chemical.

And so this chemical part here.

This chemical is why we take medicines. He tried to modulate. Right, and besides, you can eat things that get into the brain. You can modulate these. Synaptions and the idea of? Say side effect. Or what is it called when you take medicine and then you get something it's called side effect?

Yeah. Reaction to reaction like things like that those are? Reaction to the chemical is doing in a circuit. You don't want to have. Right. So, in some of those cases, they can be harmful for a person. Right, and we all know, but that's not the main point. And then, when you're describing this as like our last week?

You're describing the signal? Descartes used this cartoon years ago. Talk about signals towards the brain and away. So signals towards the grain are the sensory signals from your apparatus, like the pain reflex you need your preflex. Those are going into the brain and the spinal cord is called the brain tube.

Part of the central nervous system from our lawsuit. Right? So this is just another term he printed in the African terms. I'm talking about the New York reflex and super importance. Um. This is part of circuits that happens so. Um. For example, in the eye. So many detectors in our arm.

Detecting of life came, and if we didn't have this convergence idea, that's down on the bottom part where you have, say. We're on synaptic to two ganglions, one. Coming out of the eye. You would have a huge cable coming out of the eye. They wouldn't be able to draw us.

So, like an example of that in the world, is an owl. Values is almost all its limits to Orient to the world. It uses its A's, and it turns its head. And it hardly makes odd. So, imagine the cable coming out of the Ally to have more than us.

All right, and I can't show you this, never mind. Today, I can show it to you, like, because this convergence and it Divergence is something that happens, and it starts. Yes, sorry, this one. Never sorry, just always ask. Yeah, I just wanted to, uh, switch the bdrment on the board, but oh, b, o, r, b, o, r, vestibular, ocular.

So ocular and then refund, but if you just Google search VORs, there's no company as you. Are you sure? Yeah, I thought it's a video. So, yeah, but if I wanted to ask, um, that nystagmist I can showed us earlier. Yeah, like, is that like an example of like a valid, uh circulars, yeah, you know, yeah, it's it's full.

Yeah, so the circuit could be damaged by a tumor or something, or any messes up the firing rate and the stagnas can happen or the the beating of the eyes uncontrollably. Yeah, because the balance isn't equal across the two atmosphere to it. Right. So, out of these semicircular canals, when could it be damaged out of the six?

And it will make a bor or. The stagmus in a different way, so it's easy for like the tumor. It's some sort of, so when I was a kid? It's like a grad student undergrad. Last year, I used to go to this thing called neurophythmology round, and in the morning, David Nicole would show us like a patient, and they usually have something, and my supervisor tutors goes, who was an engineer.

But he's right into stocking World, and he just understands circuits until level. I've ever seen anyone being able to do so. David Nicole would be able to describe the thing as your Arthur mall. You should, he'll say. This is like. And I'll bring these gazing status, right, like we saw and, and he would suggest, oh, it's where the VOR comes out at the center failout, and there's a tumor summer and.

Pushing on the vestibular nerve? Yeah. And my supervisor was appreciating aside like this, right? And and then you go up the door and draw the circuit out of his head and, and he would say, no, it has to be here, because if it wasn't here, it wouldn't go past.

Right, and he just understood it at some level. And, and this is something you just learned, or he had again, yeah, right? So, uh, is that okay? Like, I know, we're getting a little off track, but it's, it's super important to understand that circuits. Yeah, it could be maladapted.

Um, this is a super simple example because. I can try to see neurons okay. I can show you why it becomes maladaptive because of whatever reason. And you see it? There could be a circuit for depression at night. Somewhere, the price he knows exists. The huge problems you don't know where it is.

You can't Target. We don't know where. Where to put my electrode? I think that the person at the same time? Right, and he knows it's coded. Like, you know how that is in the world today yesterday? It's something like one million people suffer from. Anxiety and depression. Across or whatever, seven days.

But it's a huge percentage, right? If if you could, as a student, what do you could figure out how to make ease that burden on society? Right, like everyone wants. Right? So this is about some important, not just like I gotta run for neurons and and these are the kind of questions I will ask.

The short answer you have, like, look this much on the page, but an incher, maybe three centimeters. To describe something. So, I might say, because we're talking about the VOR. I might say, well, what is the visceral operation? And you fill out this stuff and you get two markers if you get it.

Right. Our multiple choice ones that are on the test that might be like 80 or 90, multiple choice, and maybe 10 to 20 percent of your short answers, maybe a few from each chapter, but it'll be typically what we talked about in class. And like, where the questions went and and stops?

Right. So, if you wrote anything in the theater will Market it nicely, and you get too hard. But it's super simple. And that's the value coming, the added value becoming. Plus, the VOR is in the textbook, I'm sure, right. So, how are you going to know? Amongst all the like, thousands of other points.

So, this is an example of circuits. You guys did this today. These are just examples of how the circuits evolve. Um, when super important thing that we talked about in terms of like epilepsy. So, there's feedback, so imagine you have a girl on here sending accent out. And this one has a branch that shuts itself down.

Right. So this, of course, is in the middle terminal, and it will shut down the firing range to make sure there's no epilepsy at all of us. Right, I don't know whether it seems about what she is, but it's pretty rare, and it does happen somehow. In those people's brains, it doesn't shut down right, and you could be from a tumor or something like pushing on circuits that mess it up.

Right, or you can have an intro neuron this red one. That is an intermediate that is, does synapsing or that's why that shuts it down? Right. You can imagine any scenario. And it probably exists. Right, there's so many. Okay, so. So, the rest of the class, it's, it's pretty decent and Frozen.

By talking about how this stuff happens and why? And so let's just go through this. So you have a resting memory potential. So this is when a neuron is not fired.

So, neurons have processes in them that they're doing. Producing neurotransmitter, you're cleaning out garbage. Out of here, they have mitochondria doing stuff. They have lots of stuff in the South, and I'm not a cellular neuroscientist, so I don't pretend to even imagine what's happening. And I don't even think about it.

I love genetics, but I don't care about it. You'll learn the studying it. Right. So, so resting memory potential is it's a resting state, and so it might be something like a few action potentials per time. All right, just Baseline fireplace. The actual potential is pulse. That is the signal that says, I want to tell the next rest of the network.

Something is important. And he was. Right. My hands are burning because I'm touching the stove when I shouldn't right. And these kind of things, and it has to send it quick. And it does. So, we'll talk about this most of the book. When I talk about is stuff that I've studied in the last 30 years so years that I helped learn myself how to do sort of this stuff so I could do this.

I've never done intracellular recordings like this is, but this is a way to describe the action potential so you can get like a zoom in on. Right, so you use electrodes and you use micro electrodes as super fine to get in the in an axle. To this end, and hear the echo what's happening.

When you make a stimulus that's artificially is, so we're not going to have an intact human being to do this. We're gonna take out the cell or an axon or something from a giant squid.

And so they, they stick it in a dish. Right, typically with salt water. So you have the ions somebody mentioned about ions up there. And so, in the water, there's the ions you need to have this to make the sperm happen. You have a ground? It hooked up to your stimulator, and then you have something to view the current.

And that has electrode. And so this one you can put in something, and then this way you listen to that code. And you understand the biological center when they did these studies years ago. So, it's super simple, but not simple. And then, how do we measure this membrane potential so?

There's, these are just descriptions. Of something. So, the hyperpolarization is when the membrane changes hyperchlorous and depolarization. So, I think I'll draw this out. So it's easy. So, so if this is an experiment? I'll try it out as quickly on our side here to create it up. So imagine we had our dish.

We have our electrode. We have our squid axon. We have these electrodes coming in kind of looks very plug. Cool. And then, uh, what we do is with the singer there we put occur. Inject a cart right, and then on our soul soap and our empty Gadget. We measure millivolts.

And time. And what we do is we a little bit of current attack, right? So we put a little current at. And on our oscilloscope. We see a little. Right, and that's the first thing up there. I think there's one number one. Daily question a little extra bird. This is like two units.

Right, and then on our silicone. We can't go like this. Right. Let me put a little bit more. Any creatures past the brain? And this is going up to positive. This is usually in the negative. And you see this pulse and the pulse is ions coming in and out, which we'll talk about next.

Right, but the idea is describe, and this is a servant. They discovered how the action potential happens by running this similar experiment, and it's super simple now. Anyone who has a lab mostly, yeah, to do it.

So this professional of the citation is different for every neuron based on the shape and the size of that. Right, but it's always going to be a little bit more. Positive than whatever the rest is. So, the resting for this one would be minus 70. The threshold might be, say, minus 60 or minus 62.

And, and when it passes, that it's going to make this quick pause. It's the only lasts in this graph. It's about a millisecond and a half. Right, and then by three milliseconds. It's back to resting. Right, and anything. Above, the resting is called depolarization. Anything under the resting is called hyperchlorous, so you only have this little window of time here.

Wherever it was. So, if this is our resting? This little window here. Is where I call hyperbolegas.

Right. And so, again, this is like. The building Hawks of what we're trying to understand, and now not in circus. Now, we're zooming into one of the player games okay, and we're actually zooming into, like this, one location. We're reporting a harmonial part of the axon. And this is an echo that passes, so it's like you staying on the 400.

Like, there's your back. And watching the highway traffic go by. You're just seeing what's happening. Each car could be an action potential. You got transmission back and forth, and that could be an axon senior spinal cord. Up and down all the time resting your life. And we've seen this echo.

Does this make sense? Not really. Very so? I don't know where we're at now. We're we've gone way too long without a break. Um, let's do a couple more slides and then. This is another example of the resting and equalization, and this kind of magic threshold that for this specific neuron.

Right? And some of the values. And it's super easy to get next time. Right. So, on a multiple choice question. It's easy to make your properties, and I'll try not to. But like, once you understand it, and if you describe it to your neighbors like next week before class or something.

It might be easy to explain, and if you can draw it out and explain it, and label that makes an action potential is. Okay, good question. You should be able to draw it in, like, beside the multiple choice question and produce what it is. Right, and so. Hey, you know, people do this exercise where?

You hear groups, you just kind of do this. And consolidate what we're trying to learn today, and what we're describing the big, bigger circuits. And so the reason this happens. The reason that action potentials can travel down? Because there's ingredients that happen inside and outside of neuron. The inside of the environment is different than the outside.

Right. So when you make your tea or coffee in the morning sugar in it, and it takes a while to diffuse for it. The diffusion currents that happen at the neurons are the same thing. And you could magnetize them to make them move faster or bias them. And that's what the system has done.

Our brains have evolved in seawater. It's kind of like the way our ancestors. If you want to say our ancestors. Um of our essential nervous system. And so this is a zoom in. This is to zoom in on just one little part. Of the language. And I'm going to show you next, and it has these ion channels.

It has these things open, so this one's a case where an ion channel open. This one's a case where it's low. Okay, so sodium say it doesn't go through. Stuff with hands go through the sound. Experiments in animals. Once in a while, I'll be listening, so I be listening to this Echo.

Getting wrong because I'm close. I put my electrode, my micro Electrical, close to a neuron. But sometimes while you're lowering it. You might actually poke when they're on. And what could happen? Is the outside cell? Has a hole in it now that now kills the neuron. Right, so that cell now can't have this difference between the outside and the inside because it has a?

That's too bad, so things leak in and out, and that neural problem we got. Right? So it needs these receptors to maintain the balance. And we'll talk a little bit about the active balances. In fact, it's actively maintained in some of the ion channels. All right, so this is.

And again, we're zooming in on the membrane, and these are all the important players. So, if you memorize this kind of diagram or draw it out. Right. So the main things are sodium. Outside the cell, the square, the rectangle, which represents the concentration. Right, so imagine, like, sodium. It's a spoon of salt.

Right outside the cell. There's more salt. Before, so? And inside there's lights. If you look at this inside the shell, there's less so if I had a channel that opened here. That sodium channel is specific for this ion. What would happen? Right, Sony would rush into the South. Because it has.

More concentration outside than inside. But then, what's also cool is. The inside has an electric charge that's negative. And the outside has a positive charge. This is positive, and you know what magnets paws have a negative attract? Right? And you can turn the bag that you have the command that was cool.

You can turn it and then try to get it together and you feel it repack. Right? So this is what's also in every neuron and every membrane. If it doesn't exist, then you have neural transmission. And the animal or the neurons will die. They can't translate a second. Right, so it has to be like this.

Right, sodium. And chloride are more concentration outside, but because chloride is negative. You get electrostatic pressure like the mag gets being turned. So, chloride chloride channel opens. It may not rush in as much as sodium. Right, because the sodium has the force of diffusion. Because there's more concentration. It's a bigger amount of sodium outside than inside, but it also has this positive pull.

Of the charge coming in. Right? So this is super important. And I think.

11, 30 right. Yeah, so let's take a break till like 10 o'clock. 13-Minute break my mind on the law chair. Take a little break, find a washroom chat, get off the roof for a bit. And.

Oh my gosh. A very long today, maybe like another 20 minutes or something like that?

That's enough. The surrounding ions. It's as if it's as if at this excellent headlock that starts the start first action potential in the membrane. It's like the wave that transmits down through that is an electrical like pulse that's made by the ions opening the building. So, is it like surrounding ions on surrounding nerves or no, it's surrounding?

The nerve membrane is surrounded by the the fluid around it extracellular fluid. And that stuff. So? Yeah, weird, so that it's it's in the fluid, and so it's, it's equal everywhere around the world, so that there needs to be like ion flow in the unmyelin unmyelinated, uh, axon, in order for the the signal to not degrade.

The signal degrades, but it has to be regenerated somehow. Okay, you have to have, like, in the example up there, there has to be ion. Ions opening in the membrane to regenerate. All right, if there isn't. If it's a biology stuff, that's weird, because it's some genetic thing, and there won't be transmission.

It'll start, but it won't continue. So, then, in the case of sorry for for super important, like, for, for a myelinated axon, then the signal doesn't degrade. So, like then, the implication for the surrounding ions is that they don't need to. Um. Like they, they don't need to like reset the signal.

No, the ions are just floating around. Right outside the membrane. Let's go back. Sorry. Let's go back to that one that has all the ions, this one. Right, so? Even though it's showing sodium in that little box. To the to the to your like, left on the page. The sodium is everywhere outside.

Right, it's equally distributed in an equilibrium. In the fluid. Same with potassium right, and the only difference is that there's no channels here. Like, there's no sodium channels. But the sodium channels would be. Sitting outside these violent sheep? So you can imagine on the right side of this page.

There's a violin here and on the other side, there's a mile in there. And we're only looking at. Let's let me draw it again. So, the slide up there?

Making a circle?

And the violin is intake about it. So, this is a 2E view. The axon. Right, and at these thoughts, every spot. There's that open parkour. And you have the chance of sodium. Potassium chloride and there's proteins. Sitting everywhere outside there. Many equal distribution. And if the channel opens up.

So if there's? There is a stainless like watching that Lord of the Rings, right? This is a sensory order on and somewhere in the private cortex. Think we're doing experiments? Then, if there is an action potential generated, here you have sodium and potassium coming in and out of the cell.

It goes under this and then gets regenerated here. So, the idea? The idea is that the pulse is strong, it's a grades event. It degrades event, but it's still big enough. And big enough means you have this. Minus 70, it's above the threshold. Hmm, right? So, it's up here, and it regenerates it.

Transmits this way. And then, if we're measuring it here, it'll jump again. And then it degrades underneath here. And it's still big enough to then change the voltage here above threshold and then regenerates it again. And it comes under here. Strong and your grades, but it's still above threshold.

And then it generates it here again to both threshold so that it generates it here. Say it generates sodium comes in. Where the channel is opening up. And potassium leaves. That happens again, right? It's strong. It's degrading. It degrades when we measure it with our electrode. It's about threshold, so it continues at the fire.

Does that help? Drawing this crazy leg. Thing, and, and so, then, when it reaches here, it calls it's regenerated. And then, you get. Get neurotransmitter. Released to then synapse on the next one. And what's super cool about? This is like what I described there when I'm describing there? All takes like fractions into the millisecond.

Right, because the whole transmission takes 4 milliseconds. To get to here. This might take a fraction of millisecond for 10 opposed to transmit across the membrane. Right, and then this one. We'll take another four milliseconds. As if we're talking about the viewer, it has to happen fast. For you to like, walk and look at your phone or your finger.

It has to be happening fast. Like, super instantaneous, especially. As if there's a delay, you get the sadness. Be able to walk. Thank you. As you see the world moving? And at the start. There's a mismatch between the world moving and what you feel, and when I had it happened to me, I kicked.

Sushi for the night before, and it was Wasabi on my nose was disgusting. Yeah, glad I wanted to ask. It's amazingly a great battery that spun by when they did.

So the only things I remember that's unmyelinated? Is pain around sorry, you know? The example you send of, like, touching something hot? Typically, you feel something hot where the transmission is slow, so your cognition can override it. If you want to override it. So, one example I use. Right on the display.

Like years ago, I was making like turkey right for Thanksgiving dinner, and maybe I put like, I don't remember doing this, but but one of my hands had of it, one didn't. Grab these, like, handles like that are on the turkey. Like, you know, these, like, big, like pots that are making like?

It's for, like, boiling um bottles before you can this old kind of school thing. That's what my turkey thing it's got the lid. I hold it out of the oven and the door was there. I pulled it and I chose to override the signal in his hand. Wanted to drop some?

Because we were having a whole bunch of people, right? So, I took a hit on my sensory apparatus because it was slow, the signal coming from my hand to my brain that my brain could override it and say, no, don't let go. Otherwise, you're. Right, so I don't know if pain evolve.

This way to have that system, but it's the only system I know. Does that make sense? So, I have another hand here. Sorry, yeah, your hands are probably tired. Did you guys raise your hand at the same time? Um, I was just wondering. Like, if it goes below the threshold, does that mean that the stimulus has stopped?

Yeah, okay, yeah? So, so? Stay at like this one.

At this stage, it's below the threshold. Then it would stop. And then you would have nothing happen. This would not happen, and transition doesn't continue. Right, and so the example in one slide with the chemical and sexual overtoxin for the cover fish?

In the system, say here. At this part. Then it could block it. Right, so you can artificially block it here and study it here and see what happens.

Yeah, go ahead. So, um? If you have? Multiple of these? Signals that are too small, but they happen at the same time. Do they sort of add up, or they they're added to? Yeah, they're out of it. Yeah, yeah. So, if you have two small signals, they can make one.

Yeah, action potential at this stage. To sell off. At what stage would that not work? So, at the cell bodies, like any cell bodies. The transmission has to reach threshold so you can have two sub. Special stimuli integrated at the same time. Yeah, and make it past the threshold.

Yeah, but if they happen two or three milliseconds separately? Yeah, they would die off. Yeah, it has to be time for. Yeah, okay, yeah, so, like, one conflict that could happen for me is like, people can raise their hand there, and people can raise their hand there at the same time and instantaneously.

I have to make a decision you know which one, like when we just had that battle, right? I chose you because I don't know some lives that you're closer, you know? Yeah, um. But yeah, it's.

Okay, so we're almost done today. This is a lot. This is probably the hardest class. Because. The way I've kind of set up this course. Is up until we do the first midterm. These are like kind of the building blocks of learning neuroscience. Wherever odds were before you learned some of the players in terms of the behaviors.

Like, you know, we're part of Vegas. No circuits will be damaged, and we would have to artificially be doing those things right. Talk about the VOR. Now we zoom into every circuit in the right has action directions. Right? So? I don't like describing the local circuit. Um, and this is kind of what I just drew on the wall.

Right or a chalkboard there on the wall? That the signal kind of like these nodes around me, they get regenerated. And then this is an example of it as well. How underneath, there's no ion currents transmitting, but it's greater potential, just traveling. And it's kind of involved the light of the mileage.

Generated of, and it's done this to save time and save resources. Right. It's not as much ion transmission is going through and sit it in the neuron, and then. So, the sodium potassium pump doesn't have to do as much work. So, you payment. So, I imagine hanging around. That's my mind.

Has to have a lot of mitochondria today about energy. Out the sodium and push out the bring in the potassium to keep that in Balance, ready to get fire. And then this is just like some cool slides of mine. And then this last one. What happens when we go?

I showed you in a sec. But I think my dad might. Not an examples of where the diseases. The circuit. If there was a neuron that had myelin? Packed by multiple sclerosis. Tangent, where that nerd is in the circle. It's in. Por system divided in the settings. It's in the eye equipment system.

You might see what you saw in that eye movement wiggly, right? In the visual system, you might not see part of the world. Because it's damaging the visual system. If it's in the auditory system, you might not hear what is actually on the real world. You might want. Or you might get pain, right?

It really depends on where the circuit is. That takes a little detective work and a little bit of alert.

Okay, so it's a good class. It was big, you lost. I don't know where we are. I, I can't be nine minute temperature, so I might let you go fairly specific time. I love it. I don't know where we are, right? So The main thing today is you guys got to teach me something next week.

Play some news I love relationship.

No, so, so, uh? She noticed. I had the head on the box, and so she said Wayne is overcome. Should I open them? And I'd like that, it's extra. You don't have to watch all these videos from the house. I actually, I think she's so smart. Uh, any other questions related to possible?

It's nice to meet you guys. Yeah, I like spots. See you next week, man.

Okay, so.

But if I'm going?

See you next week!
