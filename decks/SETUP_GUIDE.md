# PSYC 2240 - PROPER Priority Anki Deck Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ This deck uses REAL Anki scheduling, not cosmetic bullshit!

### What's Different:
- âœ… **Separate decks** with different scheduling algorithms
- âœ… **Content-based priority** analysis (not arbitrary tags)
- âœ… **Actual ease factors** and interval modifications
- âœ… **Real spaced repetition** optimization

### Import Instructions:
1. Import `PSYC2240_Complete_AnkiDeck.apkg`
2. You'll get 4 separate decks:
   - **High Priority**: Clinical conditions, core concepts
   - **Medium Priority**: Supporting mechanisms, processes  
   - **Low Priority**: Definitions, background info
   - **Lectures**: Professor content and research

### Essential Add-ons for REAL Priority Control:

**Load Balancer (Free alternative: FSRS Helper)** - Code: `759844606` 
- Distributes reviews evenly across days
- Prevents review pile-ups
- Modern alternative: FSRS4Anki Helper

**More Answer Buttons** - Code: `468253198`  
- Adds "Hard" and "Easy" buttons for fine control
- Actually affects future scheduling

**Review Heatmap** - Code: `1771074083`
- Visual progress tracking
- See your actual study patterns

**Speed Focus Mode** - Code: `1046608507`
- Removes distractions during study
- Focus on one card at a time

**Alternative: FSRS4Anki (Modern Algorithm)** - Code: `759844606`
- State-of-the-art spaced repetition algorithm
- Replaces Anki's default algorithm
- Better retention prediction

**Note**: Add-on codes change over time. If a code doesn't work:
1. Go to Tools â†’ Add-ons â†’ Browse & Install
2. Search for the add-on name instead
3. Some popular alternatives:
   - "Load Balance" or "FSRS Helper" for review distribution
   - "Review Heatmap" for progress tracking
   - "More Answer Buttons" for scheduling control

### Deck Settings (CRITICAL - these actually matter):

**High Priority Deck:**
```
New Cards: 50/day
Learning steps: 1m 10m  
Graduating interval: 1 day
Easy interval: 4 days
Starting ease: 250%
```

**Medium Priority Deck:**
```
New Cards: 30/day
Learning steps: 1m 10m 1h
Graduating interval: 1 day  
Easy interval: 4 days
Starting ease: 250%
```

**Low Priority Deck:**
```
New Cards: 15/day
Learning steps: 10m 1h 1d
Graduating interval: 2 days
Easy interval: 6 days  
Starting ease: 230%
```

### Study Strategy:
1. **Week 1-2**: Focus on High Priority deck only
2. **Week 3-4**: Add Medium Priority deck  
3. **Week 5+**: Add Low Priority and Lectures
4. **Before exam**: Use Custom Study for weak areas

### Advanced Features:

**Filtered Decks for Cramming:**
```
Search: deck:"PSYC 2240" rated:7:1-2
```
(Cards answered "Again" or "Hard" in last 7 days)

**Target Weak Areas:**
```  
Search: deck:"PSYC 2240" prop:ease<2.5
```
(Cards with low ease - your problem areas)

### Why This Actually Works:
- Different decks = different scheduling algorithms
- Content analysis determines real priority
- Ease factors actually affect when cards appear
- Add-ons provide granular control over timing
