The Revealing Science of Social Psychology\n1.1 The Roots of Social Psychology\nAn Instinct Based View of Human Behaviour\n- Herbert Spencer extended Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection to psychology\nArgued that the social behaviour- producing properties of the mind are inherited through a process of evolution\nIn this sense, most human behaviour would be instinctively determined\nPsychoanalytic Theory: Hidden Desires Guiding Behaviour\nArgued that human behaviour is driven by aggressive and sexual desires\nAggressive behaviour is important for warding off predators + resource competition\nSexual behaviour is important for reproduction\nUnbridled aggression and sexuality undermine their own aims\nFreud believed that what we are conscious of is rarely a direct reflection of the intentions of the behaviour\nBehaviourism: Behaviour is Shaped by Experience\nIn opposition to psychoanalysis:\nJohn Watson argues that psychology should focus on overt, observable, measurable behaviour\nProposed  that human behaviour is learned in response to the demands on the environment\nPrompted early 20th century researchers to confine their viewpoints to behaviour\nThe Emergence of Modern Social Psychology\nSocial psychology emerged as a new field to address questions of what causes human behaviour\n1922 - John Dewey\nHuman behaviour is determined by both instinct and experience and the key is understanding their interaction\nBy recognising unconscious and conscious processes are important determinants of human activity could allow us to gain greater agency\n1924 - Floyd Allport\nSought to integrate the study of consciousness, behaviourism, psychoanalysis, and evolutionary theory\n1937 - Gardner, Murphy, Newcomb\nPromoted experimental procedures for studying social psychological phenomena\nShift to a Focus on Mental Processes (1970s-1980s)\nSocial psychology shifted toward understanding the mental processes that underlie behaviour – and a new perspective was formed:\nSocial Cognition Perspective:\nA view that focuses on how people perceive, remember, and interpret events and individuals, including themselves, in their social world\nToward an Integrated Perspective on Human Behaviour\nEvolutionary Perspective\nA view that humans are a species of animal and that their social behaviour is a consequence of particular evolved adaptations\nCultural Perspective\nA view that focuses on the influence of culture on thought, feeling, and behaviour\nCultural Animals\nA description of humans as viewing reality thought a set of symbols provided by the culture in which they are raised\nExistential Perspective\nA view that focuses on the cognitive, affective, and behavioural consequences of basic aspects of the human condition, such as the knowledge of mortality, the desire for meaning, and the precarious nature of identity\nSocial neuroscience Perspective\nA view that focuses on understanding the neural processes that underlie social judgement and behaviour. Neuroscience involves assessments of brain waves, brain imaging, and cardiovascular functioning\n1.2 The Four Core Assumptions of Social Psychology\nBehaviour is a Joint Product of the Person and the Situation\nBehaviour is determined by the combined influence of specific aspects of the person as well as the situation they are in\nDispositions:\nConsistent preferences, ways of thinking, and behavioural tendencies that manifest across varying situations and over time\nBehaviour Depends on a Socially Constructed View of Reality\nVirtually all human thoughts, feelings, and actions involve other people and are social in nature\nBehaviour is strongly influenced by our cognition\nTo understand behaviour, we must learn how people think about themselves and their social world\nThe best way to understand social behaviour is to use the scientific method\nThe scientific method offers the best route to accurately understanding social behaviour\nScientific Method:\nThe process of developing, testing, and refining theories to understand the determinants of social behaviour\n1.3 Cultural Knowledge: The Intuitive Encyclopedia\nAttribution Theory (Heider; 1958)\nThe view that people act as intuitive scientists when they observe other people’s behaviour and infer explanations about why those people acted the way that they did\nCausal attribution\nExplanations of an individual’s behaviour\nCultural knowledge (influences the verdict of the attribution)\nThe vast store of information, accumulated within a culture that explains how the world works and why things happen as they do\nExplaining Behaviour Through Introspection\nAsking “why did you do that”\nWhy this can be a challenge\nPeople don’t always tell the truth\nPeople often don’t know what they think they do\nPeople asked to explain why they made a certain decision may overwhelmingly make a certain set of  statements, but the data might tell a different story\nExplaining Behaviour Using Intuitive Observation\nOur observations come from our own unique and limited perspective\nOur reasoning process may be biased to confirm what we set out to assess\n1.4 The Scientific Method: Systematizing the Acquisition of Knowledge\nLOQ:\nOutline the steps in the cycle of theory and research\nExplain why correlation does not mean causation\nDistinguish between correlation and experimental methods\nExplain the importance of random assignment\nIdentify strengths of field research and quasi-experimental methods\nTheories\nAn explanation for how and why variables are related to each other\nResearch\nThe process whereby scientists observe events, look for patterns, and evaluate theories proposed to explain those patterns\nThe Cycle of Theory and Research in Psychology\nNote: a theory is not a weaker or unproven version of a fact\nFacts vs Theories in Scientific Research:\nFact:\nThe content of research observations that have been replicated by multiple researchers\nTheory:\nAn explanation for established facts\nHypothesis:\nAn ‘if-then’ statement that follows logically from a theory and specifies how certain variables should be related to each other if the results support the theory\nGenerally, a theory would generate numerous hypotheses, that would be accepted or revised after testing the theory\nStereotype Threat: Case Study of a Theory\nStereotype threat was established by the consistant observation that members of socially devalued groups (non-majority groups within a culture that are viewed negatively in some way) often perform less well on average than members of the advantaged or majority group\nPossible Hypotheses for Testing for Stereotype Threat:\nThe more people are conscious of the negative stereotype of their group, the worse they will perform in areas related to the stereotype\nPosits that there is a negative correlation between level of stereotype threat and performance — correlational\nSituations that make a negative stereotype of a person’s group prominent in a person’s mind will lead to worse performance than situations that do not\nPosits that one variable has a causal influence on the other — experimental\nResearch: The Correlational Method\nThe Correlation Coefficient\nCorrelation coefficient:\nA positive or negative numerical value that shows the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables\nCorrelation does not imply causation\nReverse causality problem:\nThe possibility that a correlation between variables x and y may occur because one causes the other, but it is impossible to determine which causes which\nThird variable problem:\nThe possibility that two variable may be correlated but do not exert a causal influence on one another, and both are caused by some additional variable\nLongitudinal studies\nStudies in which variables are measured in the same individuals over two or more periods of time, typically over months or years\nResearch: The Experimental Method\nExperimental Method\nA study in which a researcher manipulates a variable – the IV – in order to measure possible effects on another variable — the DV — while holding all other variables constant\nIndependent Variable\nThe variable being manipulated\nDependent Variable\nThe measured effect of the independent variable\nExample – Experimental Research into the Stereotype Threat Would Involve:\nManipulating research participants’ focus on the negative stereotype of their group, creating two or more conditions differing in the level of the independent variable: stereotype threat\nAssessing participants’ performance on a test relevant to that negative stereotype, providing a measurement of the dependent variable\nHolding everything else constant within that setting\nInternal Validity\nThe judgement that for a particular experiment it is possible to conclude that the manipulated independent variable caused the change in the measured dependent variable\nInteraction\nA pattern of results in which the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable depends on the level of a second independent variable\nHow Experiments Make Causal Inference Possible\nControlling the Impact of Individual Differences by Random Assignment\nRandom assignment\nA procedure in which participants are assigned to conditions in such a way that each person has an equal chance of being in any condition of an experiment\nExperimental and Correlational Research in COncert\nField Research and Quasi-Experimental Methods\nField Research:\nResearch that occurs outside the laboratory, such as in schools, office buildings, medical clinics\nQuasi-experimental designs:\nA type of research in which groups of participants are compared on some dependent variable but — for practical or ethical reasons — are unable to be randomly assigned to groups\n1.5 Theory Building: The Engine of Scientific Progress\nLOQ:\nOutline the features of a good theory\nDefine internal and external validity\nExplain the importance of replicability\nDescribe the limitations of science\nWhat makes for a good theory in social psychology\nOrganises observations\nA theory should organise the observations (facts) that come out of the research process\nTheories provide more abstract + general ways of describing the nature of reality:\nExample - Stereotype threat theory summarises and simplifies results from other studies that have shown that members of stigmatised groups perform worse when few other members of their group are present\nThe broader the range of observations that a theory can make sense of, the better:\nTheories that can account for a wide variety of observations are said to have conceptual power\nExplains observations\nTheories provide insight into how or why things happen\nTo do this the theory must be conceptually coherent and logically consistent:\nShould specify clear relationships (between variables) that help us understand the processes through which particular events in the world occur\nShould provide us with understanding that goes beyond what we already know\nShould shed new light on what we observe happening within and around us\nParsimonious:\nA theory is parsimonious if it can explain a wide range of observations with a relatively small number of basic principles:\nExamples:\nEinstein – theory of relativity\nDarwin – theory of evolution\nProvides direction for research\nA good theory should:\nEnable us to deduce clear and novel hypotheses that follow logically from its prepositions\nWill in turn lead research that tells us how well the theory fits with reality\nExample:\nResearch taking a social neuroscience perspective revealed many years after the theory was proposed that during stereotype threat, neural signatures of attention suggest that people become more vigilant toward errors that they make that might confirm the feared stereotype of their group\nGenerates new question\nA good theory should:\nShed light on phenomena beyond what the theory was originally designed to explain\nBe generative: providing new theoretical insights in other domains\nA good theory will lead to a series of questions from which to devise a new testable theory\nExample:\nStereotype threat theory has led to new ideas about performance deficits in a wide range of areas and among a wide variety of different groups of people\nHas practical value\nA good theory should:\nHave practical applications that help us solve pressing problems + improve quality of life\nExample:\nStereotype threat theory has been used to explain why remedial programs for stereotyped minorities may fail\nExample of practical value — the contact hypothesis:\nTheory from Gordon Allport; The idea that specific forms of contact between groups can break down stereotypes and negative feelings and thus reduce prejudice and intergroup conflict (practical value)\nAssessing abstract theories with concrete research\nTheories deal with abstract conceptual variables, such as attitudes, self-esteem, anxiety, attraction, conflict, etc\nOperational Definition:\nA specific, concrete method of measuring or manipulating a conceptual variable\nMeasuring and manipulating what we intend\nHow researchers operationalise variables\nOperationalising a dependent variable refers to specifying precisely how it will be measured for a specified study\nExamples — Operationalising Anxiety\nScores on a self report survey of the subjective feeling of anxiety (e.g. tension, apprehension, uneasiness, self-doubt)\nOvert behaviours that are thought (on the basis of theoretical conception) to be indicators of anxiety (e.g. fingernail chewing, rapid foot tapping, twitching eyelids)\nPhysiological measures that assess bodily symbols or signs that are thought (again, on the basis of theoretical conception) to be indicators of anxiety (e..g rapid heart rate, sweaty palms, exaggerated startle response)\nConstruct validity:\nThe degree to which:;\na dependent variable assesses what it intends to assess, OR\nan independent variable manipulates what it intends to manipulate\nWhen conceptual variables differ across experiments:\nConfound:\nA variable other than the conceptual variable intended to be manipulated that may be responsible for the effect on the dependent variable, making alternative explanations possible\nConceptual replication:\nThe replication of a study with different operationalisations of the crucial variables but yielding similar results\nIn 2015, a team of researchers (Open Science Collaboration, 2015) undertook an ambitious endeavor to replicate 100 published findings in the psychological literature.\nAmong studies that were replicated (blue dots), those with larger effects (e.g., bigger differences between conditions) in the original study (on the x-axis) also had larger effects in the new version (on the y-axis). Among those that were not replicated (in red), there was no relationship between the effect size in the original study and in the new study.\nCan findings be generalised\nCan findings be replicated\nDirect replication:\nThe process of reproducing a scientific findings by repeating the same methods and measures used in the original research study\nOpen Science Framework and Replication:\nPreregistration:\nThe practice of publishing your research protocol prior to conducting your study so that other researchers know that HARKING is not occurring\nStatistical Power analyses:\nA new statistical technique allows researchers to test the sample size required in order to make it highly likely that the results of a study can be replicated\nModerator Variables:\nVariables that explain when, where, or for whom an effect is most likely to occur\nIn stereotype threat research, group membership is a moderator variable\nAs research progresses, more moderators are discovered\nInformed replication:\nA form of conceptual replication that takes into account information + insights from previous research, including moderating variables and societal changes\nSome argue this should be the standard when replicating older studies\nMeta analysis:\nA process of analysing data across many related studies to determine the strength and reliability of a finding\nConclusions from meta analyses are often limited by the fact that studies that fail to show significant effects are seldom published\nRegistered report:\nA study that is accepted for publication on the strength of the methods and importance of the question but before results are known\nThe Limitations of Science\nThere are aspects of reality that we humans cannot know\nOur knowledge of the world originates from the information provided to us by our sense organs\nOur senses are only capable of registering a tiny fraction of things actually happening in the world – meaning that we are capable of perceiving only part of what is happening in the world, making gaining a complete understanding of reality impossible\nAlthough the scientific method may be objective, the human beings who apply it are not\nHuman nature makes a complete elimination of individual bias impossible\nPart of the difficulty in replicating scientific effects may stem from scientists’ own overconfidence in their theories that bias their analysis process\nNot all questions can be answered scientifically\nMany of the most pressing crises involve questions of values, morality, and ethics\nScience cannot tell us which values are the right ones to invest in:\nSafety or freedom\nIndividual vs collective\nShould scientific knowledge be used to restrict behaviors that are injurious to those who engage in them?\nHuman values exert a powerful influence on the way science is conducted\nExample: Studies of the genetic underpinning of behavior were discouraged in the Soviet Union because communists claimed that all differences among individuals result from environmental influences\n1.6 Ethical Considerations in Research\nHarming research participants\nAnything that can cause permanent long term damage to human participants is (obviously) out of the question\nDeceiving research participants\nIt is sometimes necessary to mislead participants about the true purpose of research:\nCover story\nAn explanation of the purpose of a study that is different from the true purpose\nTwo primary reasons for the use of deception:\nIf participants know the true purpose of the research, their responses will be affected by that knowledge\nResearch has shown that if people know (or think they know) the purpose of a study, it puts a demand on them to behave in a certain way:\nDemand characteristics\nAspects of a study that give away its purpose or communicate how the participant is expected to behave\nExperimenter bias\nThe possibility that an experimenter’s knowledge of the condition a particular participant is in could affect their behaviour toward the participant and thereby introduce a confounding variable to the independent variable manipulation\nExperimenter bias can be a source of demand characteristics:\nBlinding Researchers:\nWhenever possible, in order to eliminate experimenter bias, experiments should be designed so that they don’t know which condition a particular participant is in\nDeception is the only way to study many important psychological states and that the knowledge gained through the use of deception justifies the potential stress\nEthical safeguards\nDebriefing:\nAt the end of the study, the procedure in which participants are assessed for suspicion and then receive a gentle explanation of the true nature of the study in a manner that counteracts any negative effects of the study experience\nLec 2\n‘Man is by nature a social animal’ - aristotle, politics, c. 328 B..C\nFormal Changes in the Study of Psych\nChanges in focus (instinct, attitude, consistency, attributions, social cognition, social cognition, automatic processing, neuro culture, best research practices)\nPsychology began as studying behavior through instincts\nAttitudes are a cornerstone of social psychology\nConcern over consistency of what people are thinking about and doing\nAttributions\nThe reasons that we come up with in terms of why things happen\nChanges in focus\nSocial cognition: thinking about ourselves and others\nAutomatic information processing: that occurs below conscious awareness\nNeurosocial Psychology —\nBest research practices:\nMuch of science has lost its way in terms of the scientific method\nOur methods draw conclusions that are invalid + unreliable\nThere is a body of research devoted to determining the best research practices\nChanges in issues\nPrejudice – studies of this came out of WWII\nViolence + Crime: studied into the 60s + 70s\nMulticulturalism, morality, religion\nChanges in participants:\nGender of participants (initial studies in academic institutions were more on men (because women were not allowed to go to university)\nMen dominated universities, but a lot of the research went to the community (but they still studied men) — Then it Switched:\nCommunity → college\nMTurkers\nMturkers are experienced survey takers\nThey can be skilled at pinpointing demand characteristics\nSocial desirability – (and also they’re compensated more when they confirm the researchers’ hypotheses)\nMen → women (the focus switched to women:\nPotentially because of the poor research outcomes for females – who seek to course-correct for the male dominated outset of the discipline and the poor research that it produced\nIntegration of education (female-dominated) into the discipline of psychology\nChanges in analysis (Univariate, Multivariate, Mediation)\nEarly days were characterised by univariate analyses:\nCharacterised by a small number of variables\n→ progressed into multivariate analysis:\nInvolves multiple predictor variables and multiple outcome variables\nThe limited capacity of the human memory means that we are consistently making inferences about our data – which is why sometimes it is better to use less variables rather than more\nMediation:\nThe “why” of why variable A is related to or causes B\nExample: Why are boys more aggressive than girls?\nTestosterone = mediator\nChanges in research methods (questionable research methods in historical experiments)\nWhat do social psychologists study?\nSocial Cognition:\nHow individuals make sense of themselves and other individuals\nSocial neuroscience:\nHow the brain’s structures and functions related to social cognitions, emotions, and behaviours\nResearch methods:\nParticularly questionable research practices such as p-hacking, novel hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) —\nWhat is research:\nThe method of asking and answering a question with a set of systematic procedures which assist researchers in avoiding biases\nWhen we’re assessing people, we are often benchmarking people according to an average\nNormal distributions are representative of the average\nBiases:\nSelf-serving bias:\nThe tendency that we have to view ourselves favorably\nFunctionally beneficial: people who are happy are more socially engaged\nIllusory correlations:\nSeeing associations where none exist\nFundamental attribution error:\nThe tendency to overestimate the impact of the person (disposition) and underestimate the impact of the situation\nActor/Observer bias:\nWhen judgements are affected by the perspective of the judge\nHedonic Bias:\nA desire to maximise good things and minimise bad things\nThese factors affect both the types of questions we ask and the ways that we go about answering them\nThe scientific method acknowledges that human beings are innately biased, and provides us with a systematic means of addressing and minimizing bias\nTheory:\nA reasonable set of variables or constructs that interrelate and help us to understand why and how things unfold\nReasonable set = not too many variables and not too few\nHypothesis testing – steps:\nBegin with a research question — is there a relationship between watching violence on television and acting aggressively\nChoose a theory – there is a relationship between watching violent television and aggressive behaviour\nMake a hypothesis — does watching violent TV increase aggressive behaviour in children?\nRandom sample\nIf you take 1200 people from a population, you can be 95% confident that your sample is representative (although this is impractical, and all of the samples we receive\nThe only way that a random sample is truly possible is through phone surveys + interviews — allowing for a margin of error\n3 Methods of Research:\nEVERY RESEARCH METHOD HAS SIGNATURE MARKERS:\nGather a sample\nTest hypothesis using 1 of 3 methods\nNonexperimental (sometimes called correlational)\nSignature: must be observable and quantifiable\nInvolves examining the relationship between two or more naturally occurring variables\nNaturally occurring = ??\nSteps:\nObtain a random sample from the population\nObtain measures on two sets of variables that you think are related\nStatistically test the relationship\nGeneralise the findings based on the sample back to the population (only possible if randomly sampled, and the sample must be representative)\nSignature: The criteria or signature of a nonexperimental study is that the variables need to be (1) observable and (2) measurable; in a natural setting\nSelf-reported verbal measure – Likert Scale:\nHas two items that reflect one issue\nThe items are weighted equally\nOne reflects a favorable view of that issue\nOne reflects an unfavorable view of that issue\n(True) correlational:\n(+ television, – aggression) (+ television, +aggression) (\nCatharsis theory would say that watching violent TV provides an outlet for violent impulses (bullshit)\nStrengths of nonexperimental methods — what they can tell us:\nWhether two variables are related\nIf some phenomena is predictable based on knowledge of another variable\nReasons for noncausal relations:\nDirection of relationship is impossible to determine (TV → AGG, AGG → TV)\nPossible 3rd variable problem (i.e. abuse)\nExperimental\nSignature of Experiment: (1)  Manipulation of IV + (2)  RANDOM ASSIGNMENT:\nWhere everyone has an equal chance of being selected into each group; with the aim of having a representative sample\nBUT if it’s a biassed sample (i.e. 70% boys) — we NEED to reflect that bias in the assignment\nIf that bias ISN’T reflected, then the sample is a biassed sample (kind of counterintuitive)\nConfound:\nWhen one variable systematically changes with another variable (i.e. gender [testosterone, expectations])\nIn its most basic form, an experiment has two groups\nTreatment group\nControl group (similar in every way except for the EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION)\nIf the control group is barney , and the treatment group is power rangers, and those are the only differences between the groups, then an increase in violence in the experimental group can only be attributed to power rangers\nIf there is a difference between the groups, then the variable of interest must be the cause\nHow to Conduct an Experiment\nDesign materials and procedures to manipulate the IVs\nChoose a sample and randomly assign them to different conditions\nMeasure the effects of the IVs on the DVs\nGeneralise the results from the laboratory to life\nNote: a theory is only valuable if it can be proven false\nA theory that predicts everything, predicts nothing\nWe want to be able to say situation X happens in place A, but not place B\nTHIS IS NOT POSSIBLE – gender cannot be manipulated + randomly assigned… hence…\nQuasi-experimental\nWhen we have a variable that we may not be able to manipulate (because of ethics, practicality, etc)\nWhen you have one experimental (can manipulated and randomly assign) crossed with another variable that (for whatever reason) cannot be randomly assigned\nHypothesis: the effect of TV Violence depends on the ‘BOY’ level of gender\nMain Effect: VIOLENCE X NO VIOLENCE\nMain Effect: GIRLS VS BOYS\nInteraction: GENDER X VIOLENCE/NO VIOLENCE\nDrawing Causal Conclusions:\nWe can only draw causal conclusions around the manipulated + randomly assigned variable (TV violence)\nNot gender\nAnd not the interaction\nLearning Theory:\nLearning theory states that changes in behaviour occur as functions of experience…\nWhen we are faced with stimuli, we have certain responses\nStimulus → response\nThere is thinking/cognition involved – that behaviourism/learning theory doesn’t take into account\nConsistency/Balance Theory\nHolds that human beings strive for balance and consistency between what they think and what they do; when there is an imbalance between those things, there is a cognitive dissonance\nWhen cognition and behaviour don’t align\nChange cognition to = behaviour\nChange behaviour to = cognition\nI.e. smoking:\nSmoke less, or make excuses\nDissonance Theory:\nRecall: “We act on the perceived rather than the actual”\nLouis Festinger: there are inconsistencies between cognition and behaviour, and when that happens we are motivated to get them back in balance\nClaimed that it was more likely to change cognition – because behaviour is public because no one wants to embarrass themselves\nUsed in Public Safety:\nCognitive behaviour therapy = aims to get people to change their behaviours by changing their thought processes\nTickets for not wearing seatbelts\nAttribution Theories\nA family of theories that describe how people come up with the causes and reasons of how /why things happen\nValue in describing the value of negative things that happen to people, because they have helpful implications for human life\nCriticism of Attribution Theory\nMay oversimplify the complex process of social attribution in a similar manner to behaviourism\nStimulus → Response ; when it should be:\nStimulus → cognition → response\nExchange & Equity Theory\nPosits that we operate behaviourally in terms of an economic model\nCh2. Fundamentals of Behaviour\n2.1 Evolution: How Living Things Change over Time\nEvolution:\nThe concept that different species are descended from common ancestors but have evolved over time, inquiring different genetic characteristics as a function of different environmental demands\nNatural selection:\nThe process by which certain attributes are more successful in a particular environment and therefore become more represented in future generations\nNatural Selection:\nPrimary sources of gene variability include:\nMutation\nSexual recombination\nThe second key element is competition:\nResources (i.e. mating partners, food, etc) are limited, and tiny variations might give a leg up\nAdaptation:\nAttributes that improve an individual’s prospects for survival and reproduction\nDefining ‘Fittest’ in survival of the fittest\nWhat defines “fittest” depends entirely on the natural environments in which the organisms reside (i.e. climate, temperature, biome, resource availability/scarcity)\nBecause variability is neither good nor bad (it’s effects are determined by who survives), it would be incorrect to assume that genetic mutations are all good or all bad, as well\nBipedalism:\nBenefits\nFree up hands for using tools\nDownsides:\nSlipped disks\nFallen arches\nShin splints\nNaturalistic Fallacy:\nA bias toward believing that biological adaptations are inherently good or desirable\n2.2 General Adaptations of the Cultural Animal\nDomain-specific adaptations:\nAttributes that evolved to meet a particular challenge but that are not particularly useful when dealing with other challenges\nDomain-general adaptations:\nAttributes that are useful for dealing with various challenges across different areas of life\nHumans as social beings\nCh1: behaviour depends on a socially constructed view of reality\nExamples of how adaptive sociability + social sensitivity are:\nThe fusiform face area functions specifically to recognise human faces\nAllows us to discriminate between unique faces and recognise additional information conveyed by them\nSocial rejection triggers a strong negative reaction in the brain – activating the same brain regions responsible for generating feelings of physical pain\nWe categorise people in ways that help social interactions go smoothly (labelling as friend or foe – allows predictability\nThe same areas of the brain that are active in rest are also active when thinking about the social world\nMedial frontoparietal network — suggests that the resting brain is preparing to think about others/consolidate information\nSocialisation:\nLearning from parents and others what is desirable and undesirable conduct in a particular culture\nHumans as Intelligent Beings\nImagination\nSymbolic Thought and Language: The Great Liberators\nThe Self\nConsious and Nonconsious aspects of thinking\nHumans as motivated, goal-striving beings:\nNeeds + Goals\nHedonism: Approaching pleasure, avoiding pain\nTwo fundamental psychological motives: security and growth\n2.3 Culture: The Uniquely Human Adaptation\nWhat is culture?\nCulture:\nA set of beliefs, attitudes, values, norms, morals, customs, roles, statuses, symbols, and rituals shared by a self-identified group, a group whose members think of themselves as a group\nCommon (but also Distinctive) elements of culture:\nBeliefs:\nAccepted ideas about some aspect of reality\nCultural truisms = beliefs that are so deeply ingrained that they are never disputed\nBeliefs create expectations that structure our experience of the world\nAttitudes:\nPreferences, likes, dislikes, and opinions about what is good and bad\nRelated to beliefs - but evaluative\nValues:\nIdeas reflective of members’ guiding principles and shared goals\nValue x Outcome\nSocietal agreement in ratings:\nBenevolence(top) → self direction → universalism\nNorms:\nShared beliefs about what is appropriate or expected behaviour in particular situations\nEvery culture has situations that involve strong norms (i.e. courtrooms)\nMorals:\nBeliefs about what constitutes good or bad behaviour\nTypes of morals\nCommunity morals — concerning relationships\nAutonomy morals — concerning individuals’ rights and freedoms\nDivinity morals — concerning what is sacred + pure\nTheory of dyadic morality:\nArgues that all violations of morals fundamentally involve an individual (or group) harming another in some way\nCustoms\nSpecific patterns or styles of dress, speech, and behaviour that, within a given culture, are deemed appropriate in particular contexts\nSocial Roles\nPositions within a group that entail specific ways of acting and dividing labor, responsibilities, and resources\nCultural symbols\nRepresent either the culture as a whole or beliefs and values prevalent in that culture\nI.e. flags for shared nationality, religious symbols for shared religion\nRituals:\nPatterns of actions performed in particular contexts that reinforce cultural beliefs, values and morals\nOften signifies a change associated with the end or beginning of something biological, historical, or culturally significant\nCulture as creative adaptation\nCultural evolution:\nThe process whereby cultures develop and propagate according to systems of belief or behaviour that contribute to the success of a society\nCultural diffusion\nThe transfer of inventions, knowledge, and ideas from one culture to another\nCultural transmission\nThe process whereby members of a culture learn explicitly or implicitly to imitate the beliefs and behaviours of others in that culture\n2.4 How Culture Helps us Adapt\nLOQ:\nDescribe how culture influences the way people adapt to the physical, social, and metaphysical environment\nExplain why socioeconomic development may push a society toward greater individualism\nIdentify ways that people cope with the knowledge of their own mortality\nWarner (1959) - proposed that culture helps people adapt to three aspects of their environment\nThe Physical environment\nThrough the development of skills and tools that help people meet the goals of survival and reproduction\nThe social environment\nThrough the development of social roles, relationships, and order\nThe metaphysical environment\nThrough the development of cultural worldviews that provide answers to existential questions about purpose and existenc\nCulture and the natural environment\nThe development of skills from primitive lifestyles → hand axes → control of fire → basic shelters\nSurvival became dependent on living in groups and learning how to do things that were invented/discovered by others\nCulture, cognition, and perception\nHow a given culture adapts to its physical surroundings has a significant impact on people’s perceptions and thought processes\nPeople in hunter/gatherer societies have exceptionally strong visual/spatial abilities\nThe vocabulary of the Eskimo language reflects and reinforces the spatial abilities that infclude words that make elaborate spatial and geometric diestinctions\nCulture and the social environment\nUncertainties of group living\nA universal issue in all cultures lies in knowing\nWhat they should do\nWhat they are allowed to do\nUncertainty-identity theory:\nSuggests that people identify with culturally defined groups that have clear guidelines for behaviour, in order to reduce the uncertainty\nHow individuals relate to each other – individualism / collectivism\n4 Basic Patterns of Social Relations:\nCommunity sharing\nCooperation and self-sacrifice are prevalent and “what’s mine is yours”\nAuthority ranking\nIn which one person gives order and the other follows them (i.e. army)\nEquality matching\nEveryone is treated equally and has the same rights\nMarket pricing\nRelationships follow economic principles (i.e. businesses)\nFitting in and sticking out\nCollectivistic Cultures:\nPrioritise behaving n a manner that fits expectations and sustains social harmony\nLess important: expressing personal attitudes, preferences, and outperforming other\nSmall frogs in big ponds – i.e. less individually successful in a more prestigious group\nPeople who break rules are strongly disliked\nIndividualistic Cultures\nPeople strongly value freedom of speech and are encouraged to express their personal view, evne if they cause debate\nPeople who break rules can seem powerful\nEmotion\nCollectivistic\nHarmony = priorising social cohesion over the freedom to broadcast emotional reactions\nExample:\nJapanese participants who viewed a video of a circumcision in front of an experimenter dulled their reactions\nAmericans did not, and Japanese participants did not when the experimenter was not present\nSuggests that Asian patients may display signs of discomfort in different ways – potential implications for healthcare\nModernisation and cultural values\nModernisation:\nIncreased socioeconomic development; industrial, technological, and economic advancements; and democratisation\nOverall, the trend toward democratisation may lead toward a rise in individualistic values\nSocial policies allow for immigration\nTechnology makes it easier to maintain native connections as an immigrant\nCulture and the metaphysical environment\nCulture helps people gain an understanding of the nature of reality and the significance of their lives within the cosmic order of things\nWhy are people preoccupied with understanding their place in the metaphysical environment\nDrawbacks of our intelligence:\nAwareness that the only certain thing about life is that it will end some day\nAwareness of the fragility of life in an animal that seeks survival creates the potential for paralyzing terror\nIn the mid-1980s, Sheldon Solomon, Tom Pyszczynski, and Jeff Greenberg synthesized Becker’s ideas into..\nTerror management theory (TMT):\nA theory which says that to minimise fear of mortality, humane strive to sustain faith that they are enduringly valued contributors to a meaningful world and therefore transcend their physical death\nEach culture has created answers to these questions…\nCultural worldviews:\nHuman-constructed shared symbolic conceptions of reality that imbue life with meaning, order, and permanence\nAll cultural worldviews consist of:\nA theory of reality that provides answers to basic questions about life, death, the cosmos, and one’s place in it\nInstitutions, symbols, and rituals that reinforce components of that worldview\nA set of standards of value that prescribe what is good and bad and what it means to be a good human being\nThe promise of actual or symbolic immortality to those who believe in the worldview and live up to the standards that are a part of it\nCreation stories….\nInstitutions, symbols, rituals: worldview transmission and maintainance\nBases of self-worth: standards, values, social roles, and self-esteem\nSelf-esteem:\nThe level of positive feeling one has about oneself\nJust world beliefs:\nThe idea that good things will happen to the worthy and bad things will happen to the unworthy; term coined by Melvin Lerner\nImmortality\nLiteral immortality:\nA culturally shared belief that there is some form of life after death for those who are worthy\nSymbolic immortality:\nA culturally shared belief that, by being part of something greater and more enduring than our individual selves, some part of us\nBiosocial immortality\nThe notion that people live on through their descendants and identity with larger collectives such as nations that are presumed to continue indefinitely\nCreative immortality\nResults from contributions to one’s culture\nNatural immortality\nResults from strongly identifying with nature + recognising that one will live on through nature\nExperimental immortality:\nResults from ‘peak experiences’ (Maslow)\nThe essential role of social validation\nConfidence in the absolute correctness of our own beliefs and values is bolstered primarily through social consensus and social validation\nTMT proposes that people protect themselves from the fear of death by immersing themselves in a world of symbols and ideas provided by their culture\nThus it makes sense that people will — often without any logical reason — strongly identify with cultural values…\nThe threat of other cultures: root cause of prejudice\nThis suggests that views socially validated by others, may not be absolutely true — and the response to that is to minimise the threat to their cultural worldview posed by alternative cultural worldviews.\nHypothesis:\nIf cultural worldviews function to alleviate anxiety associated with the awareness of death, then reminding people of their mortality should increase the need for the protection provided by such beliefs\nWorldview defense:\nThe tendency to derogate those who violated important cultural ideals and to venerate those who uphold them\nDefending the worldview\nAccording to terror management theory, cultural worldviews protect people against mortality fears. Supporting evidence shows that people primed to think about their deaths—that is, in a state of mortality salience—adhere more closely to their cultural worldview.\nIn this study, after being reminded of death, judges imposed more punitive judgments on a prostitute because prostitution violates the cultural worldview’s standards for good and bad behavior.\nCultural beliefs as a protective shield\nDeath thought accessibility hypothesis:\nThreats to peoples’ terror management resources increase how accessible thoughts of death are to consciousness\nThe role of death\nCulture as a synthesis of human-created adaptations\n2.5 Culture in the Round: Central Issues\nDoes culture illuminate or obscure reality?\nIs culture a good or bad thing\nIs culture a monolith??\nCh4. Thinking About People and Events\n4.1 Remembering Things Past\nLOQ:\nExplain how memories are formed\nDescribe evidence which shows that memories are often reconstructions rather than objective facts\nExplain how schemas shape memories and thus our view of the world\nRelate the misinformation effet to the reliability of eyewitness testimony\nHow are memories formed – short and long term\nShort-term memory\nInformation or input that is currently activated\nLong-term memory\nInformation from past experience that may or may not be currently active\nSocial media and memory\nResearch shows that dividing your attention between your phone and an experience can impair your ability to remember that experience\nHow we remember\nWe construct an idea of what happened by bringing bits of evidence to mind\nWe then pull those pieces of evidence together to try to create a coherent picture of what happened\nMemory for Schema-Consistent and Schema-Inconsistent Information\nA woman says she liked beer and classical music\nThose who believed she was a waitress recalled that she liked beer\nThose who believed she was a librarian were more likely to recall she liked classical music\nIt is easier to remember information that is consistent with our schemas\nAlthoug sometimes information that is inconsistent with schemas can also be memorable\nOften memories of events where people behave in ways that are not customary\nMood congruent memory:\nWe are more likely to remember positive information in a positive mood and negative information in a negative mood\nThe Misinformation Effect\nMisinformation effect:\nThe process by which cues that are given after an event can plant false information into memory\nExample\nPeople rated a car as moving faster when it “smashed” into another car vs when it “hit” another car\nEyewitness Testimony\nFalse Memories in Eyewitnesses\nRape victim studied a photographic lineup — was told “good job” when she selected an individual who later turned out to be innocent\nAffirmation of the tentative identification strengthened her false belief\nRepeated images throughout the trial reinforced her memory…\nFalse Confessions:\nA study showed that researchers were able to reliably convince college students that in their youth they had committed a crime that they did not commit – telling the youth that they were told by their parents\nBy the third interview, 70% of participants falsely remembered having committed a crime at age 12\nThe availability heuristic and ease of retrieval\nAvailability heuristic:\nOur tendency to overestimate the frequency/commonality of information that easily comes to mind or is readily available\nEase of retrieval effect:\nThe process whereby people judge how frequently an event occurs on the basis of how easily they can retrieve examples of the event\n4.2 Inferring Cause and Effect in the Social World\nCommon Sense Psychology:\nCausal attributions:\nExplanations of an individual’s behaviour\nDimensions of Causal Attributions:\nLocus of Causality:\nAttribution of behaviour to either an aspect of the actor (internal) or to some aspect of the situation (external)\nThe second dimension is Stability:\nAttributing behaviour to either changeable or unchangeable factors\nAn internal attribution for a poor performance or a negative action reflects poorly on the actor, whereas an external attribution tends to let the actor off the hook.\nOn the other hand, an internal attribution for a positive behavior generally leads to a positive impression of the actor, whereas an external attribution for a positive action undermines the benefit to the actor’s image.\nAttributions to stable factors lead to strong expectations of similar behavior in similar situations, whereas attributions to unstable factors do not\nDweck:\nBoys attribute their math difficulties to lack of effort\nGirls attribute their difficulties to a stable internal cause; lack of math ability\nReasoned that girls were more likely to give up on math, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy\nFixed and incremental mind sets\nSomewhat related to perceptions of stable/unstable dimensions:\nPeople generally have dispositional tendencies to hold either fixed or incremental mind sets about human attributes; but those views can be changed\nFixed Mind-Set: attributing failure or shortcomings to static, fundamental deficits in ability\nIncremental Mind-Set: attributing failure or shortcomings to dynamic deficits in ability that can be improved with effort\nAutomatic processes in causal attribution\nCausal schema:\nA theory that we hold about the likely cause of a specific kind of event’\nI.e, my mom, who usually makes coffee every morning, makes tea instead one morning; this would be unexpected and I would wonder why…\nCultural perspective\nSeeing people from other cultures engage in customary / traditional behaviours that don’t have a clear desired outcome to us would require a more elaborate process of determining attribution\nThe Fundamental Attribution Error:\nCorrespondent interference:\nThe tendency to attribute to an actor an attitude, desire, or trait that corresponds to the action\nSomeone has a beard and drives a truck so I assume they are conservative\n3 Conditions Correspondent Interference Occurs:\nThe individual seems to have a choice in taking an action\nA person has a choice between two courses of action, and there is only one difference between one choice and the other\nSomeone acts inconsistently with a particular social role\nAll 3 of these factors increase the likelihood of correspondent interference – but we often jump to correspondent interference without even considering these logical factors\nFundamental attribution error (FAE):\nThe tendency to attribute behaviour to internal or dispositional qualities of the actor and consequently underestimate the causal role of situational factors\nHow Fundamental is the FAE:\nActor-observer effect:\nThe tendency to make internal attributions for the behaviour of others and external attributions for our own behaviour\nFinger pointing\nWhen things are going bad in a relationship, each actor is likely to view the external situation (i.e. the other person or entity) that is salient as being responsible for the problems\nDoes FAE occur across cultures?\nSome evidence shows that socialisation in a collectivistic culture might sensitize people to contextual explanations of behaviour (diminishing FAE)\nWhen the goal is to judge a person, we universally (across the globe) tend to judge people by their behaviour\nWhen the goal is to judge the cause of a behaviour, there is cultural variation in how much of the behaviour is attributed to the person vs the situation\n3 Stage Model: Dispositional Attribution\nGilbert – 3 Stage Model for the Attribution Process:\nA behaviour is observed and labelled\nObservers automatically make a correspondent dispositional inference\nIf observers have sufficient accuracy motivation and cognitive resources available, they modify their attributions to take salient situational factors into account\nPeople who are cognitively strained are less likely to correct their dispositional judgements of others\nElaborate Attributional Processes\nCausal Hypothesis Testing\nPutting effort into making an attribution is analogous to testing a hypothesis:\nCovariation principle:\nThe (often misinformed) tendency to see a causal relationship between an event and an outcome when they happen at the same time\nOnce we have an initial hypothesis, we father information to assess the plausability\nHigh need for closure, low need for accuracy = discount other possibilities\nLow need for closure, high need for accuracy = consider other possibilities\n3 Kinds of Info: Consistency, Distinctiveness, and Consensus\nWhen an attribution is high in consistency, consensus, and distinctiveness, we attribute the behaviour (her love for the movie) to an external cause (a great movie)\nDiscounting Principle:\nThe tendency to reduce the importance of any potential cause of another’s behaviour to the extent that other potential causes exist and are salient\nBarry Bonds and Alex Rodruigez were accused of steroid use, and people discounted their achievements because of this attribution\nMotivational Bias in Attribution\nOur attributions are biased by our preferred view of the way the world works (our desire to maintain specific beliefs)\nMagical Thinking:\nThe tendency to believe that simply having thoughts about an event before it occurs can influence that event\n4.3 What If, If Only: Counterfactual Thinking\nLOQ:\nExplain why the ease of generating a counterfactual influences emotional reactions\nDifferentiate between downward and upward counterfactuals\nExplain when it is more productive to generate upward than downward counterfactuals\nIdentify four essential ways people make sense of the world (as presented)\nThe more easily we can mentally undo an event, the stronger our reaction to it\nOur reaction to losing a game that was head to head for so long would be significantly more intense than our reaction to a game where we were significantly behind\nUpward Counterfactuals\nUpward counterfactual:\nAn imagined alternative in which the outcome is better than what actually happened\nDownward Counterfactuals\nDownward counterfactuals:\nAn imagined alternative in which the outcome is worse than what actually happened\nUpward and downward counterfactuals and personal coomplishments: the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat\nCounterfactuals affect how we feel about our own achievements\nBronze medalists: grateful they won a medal (DC)\nSilver medalists: wished they won gold (UC)\nIs it better to Generate Upward or Downward Counterfactuals\nDepends on the situation\n4.4 Forming Impressions of People\nFaces, Physical Attributes, and Group Membership\nFusiform face area:\nA region in the temporal love of the brain that helps us recognise the people we know\nProsopanosia:\nThe inability to recognise familiar faces\nPossible protective/adaptive mechanism for allowing us to stay away from dangerous people, places, etc\nImpression Formation\nPeople form initial impressions of people in one of two ways: from the bottom up, or from the top down\nBuilding an Impression from the Bottom-Up: Decoding the Behaviour/Minds of Others\nWe build bottom-up impressions by\ngathering individual observations of a person to form an overall impression\nAs we listen and observe, we infer their traits, attitudes, intentions, and goals\nNegativity bias:\nthe tendency to weigh instances of negative behaviour more heavily than incidences of positive ones\nBrief Encounters\nResearch shows that brief impressions of people tend to be fairly accurate, and that extended exposure does not significantly improve accuracy\nTheory of Mind\nTheory of Mind:\nA set of ideas about other peoples’ thoughts, desires, feelings, and intentions based on what we know about them and the situation they are in\nMost children develop a theory of mind around age 4 – because this is when they figure out their beliefs + desires are separate from those of others\nAutism:\nEven in high-functioning forms of autism, the ability to to determine a person’s emotions on the basis of expressions, tones, can be diminished\nMedial Prefrontal Cortex + Mirror Neurons:\nMirror neuron:\nCertain neurons that are activated both when one performs an action oneself and when one observes another person perform that action; basis for learning\nBuilding an Impression from the Top Down: Perceiving others Through Schemas\nTransference\nTendency to map on, or transfer, feelings for a person who is known onto someone new who resembles that person in some way\nFalse consensus\nGeneral tendency to assume that other people share our attitudes, opinions, and preferences\nBenefits of Thinking this Way:\nOur own opinions and behaviours are most likely to come to mind when we consider what other people think/do\nIt is validating for our worldview\nWe want to associate with people who are similar to us (availability heuristic)\nI overestimate the frequency of smokers because all my friends smoke\nImplicit personality theories\nTheories that we have about which traits go together and why they do\n“Bob”: described as “Warm”, and “Jason” described as “Cold”\nHalo Effect:\nTendency to assume that people with one positive trait (i.e. physical attractiveness) also have other positive traits\nStereotyping\nRepresentativeness Heuristic:\nTendency to overestimate the likelihood that a target is part of a category if the person has features that seem representative of that category\nStereotypes and Individuation\nWhen people engage in stereotyping, they are operating from a top down process\nHere: people described John differently simply because the order in which traits were described were different:\nChanging First Impressions\nPrimacy effect:\nThe idea that we what we learn early influences how we judge subsequent information\nCh5. The Nature, Origins, and Functions of the Self\n5.1 Social Influences on the Self-Concept\nLOQ:\nOutline some influences of culture on the self-concept\nExplain how gender and culture interact to shape the self-concept\nDescribe how shifting social contexts create change in the self-concept\nSelf-concept:\nA person’s knowledge about themself, including traits, social identities, and experiences\nCulture\nSocial identity theory;\nThe theory that group identities are an important part of self-definition and a key source of self-esteem\nGroups and self-definition\nGroups that were told their group was high in a trait they had never heard of before assumed themselves to be high in that trait\nGender\nWe learn gendered behaviour from our culture\nPeople learn from their cultures what behaviours and self views are appropriate for their gender\nChildren tend to strongly identify with the same sex parent and mimic those traits and qualities\nSocial role theory:\nThe theory that gender differences in behaviour, personality, and self-definition arise because of a long history of role distribution between the sexes and error prone assumptions that those roles are essential to the nature of men and women\nContext\nSelf-schema:\nAn integrated set of memories, beliefs, and generalisations about a personally important attribute that defines the self\nWorking self concept:\nA set of self-aspects that are currently activated by situational cues and strongly influence thoughts, feelings, and actions in the moment\nSolo status:\nA sense that one is unique in some specific manner in relation to other people in the current environment\n5.2 How Do We Come to Know the Self?\nLOQ:\nApply the concept of reflected appraisals to explain how people come to know and evaluate themselves\nDifferentiate between the influence of upward and downward comparisons on the self-concept\nExplain how self-perception guides people to use their own behaviour and bodily experiences as clues to who they are\nReflected Appraisals: Seeing Ourselves Through the Eyes of Others\nSymbolic Interactionism\nThe perspective that people use their understanding of how others view them as the primary basis for knowing and evaluating themselves\nLooking Glass Self\nThe idea that others reflect back to us (like a mirror) who we are by how they behave towards us\nAppraisals\nWhat other people think about us\nErrors in Reflected Appraisals\nReflected appraisals:\nWhat we think other people think about us\nSocial Comparison: Knowing the Self Through Comparison with Others\nSocial comparison theory\nThe theory that people come to know themselves partly by comparing themselves with similar others\nDownward comparison\nA comparison of oneself with those who are worse off\nUpward comparison\nA comparison of oneself with those who are better off\nErrors in Social Comparison\nBetter-than-average effect:\nThe tendency to rank oneself higher than most other people on positive attributes\nWhy people make this error:\nPeople who lack the knowledge of what they do well don’t understand the criteria of being ‘good at it’\nThe skills needed to produce correct responses are virtually identical to those needed to evaluate the accuracy of one’s responses\nSelf-Perception Theory: Knowing the Self by Observing One’s Own Behaviour\nSelf-perception theory:\nThe theory that people sometimes infer their attitudes and attributes by observing their behaviour and the situation in which it occurs\nUsing One’s Movements to Know the Self\nFacial feedback hypothesis:\nThe idea that changes in facial expression elicit emotions associated with those facial expressions\ni.e. smiling can elicit happiness\nErrors of Self-Perception\nWe often lack insight into who we are and how we feel\nWe look to our own behaviour to make inferences about what we are like\nThose inferences can be incorrect when we misjudge how situations affect us\nUsing the Self to Know One’s Feelings\nTwo Factor Theory of Emotion:\nThe theory that people’s emotions are the product of both their arousal level and how they interpret that arousal based on contextual cues\nWhen we observe our own behaviour, we can make mistakes about the origins of our arousal — and experience emotions fueled from something else entirely\nMisattribution of arousal:\nInadvertent ascription of arousal resulting from one source, to a different source\nExcitation transfer theory:\nThe theory that leftover arousal caused by an initial event can intensify emotional reactions to a second, unrelated event\nSection Review\nReflections, comparisons, and self-perceptions are three important ways that people learn about themselves during the course of their everyday social interactions.\n5.3 Self-Regulation\nSelf-regulation:\nA set of processes for guiding one’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviour to reach desired goals\nThe ability to self-regualte is based on 3 key capacities of the human mind that emerged alongside our advanced cortexes:\nPeople are self aware – able to assess in relation to the world around them\nPeople can imagine abstract goals and hypothetical outcomes\nPeople are able to mentally travel back in time and envision the distant future\nSelf-Awareness and Self-Regulation\nSelf-awareness theory:\nThe theory that aspects of the self — one’s attitudes, values, and goals — will be most likely to influence behaviour when attention is focused on the self\nSelf-Awareness Promotes Behaving in Line with Internal Standards\nThe notion of hope\nPeople with high feelings of hope view obstacles as challenging opportunities for growth rather than as reasons for giving up on life\nWhat Feelings Does Self-Awareness Arouse\nSelf-discrepancy theory:\nThe theory that people feel anxiety when they fall short of how they ought to be but feel sad when they fall short of how they ideally want to be\nStaying on Target: How Goals Motivate and Guide Action\nActivating Goals: Getting Turned On\nThere are theories that in addition to making commitments to achieve desired end states (method 1), there is another method of motivating oneself\n— the notion that we often pursue goals without any conscious awareness that we are doing so (i.e. when I am studying this textbook, I am actually studying for a degree)\nAuto-motive theory:\nThe theory that even subtle exposure to goal-related stimuli can automatically activate a goal and guide behaviour\nThe significance of comparing oneself\nAfter being subliminally primed with the name of a close other who expects them to succeed, participants persisted for more time on their goals\nDefining Goals as Concrete or Abstract\nAction identification theory:\nThe theory that explains how people conceive of action — either their own or others’ — in ways that range from very concrete to very abstract\nExample – 3 Bricklayers working on the same project\nMan #1: “I’m laying brick”\nMan #2: “I’m building a wall”\nMan #3: “I’m building a cathedral”\nSimple → abstract = how(simple) → why (abstract)\nSelf-Regulation and the Psychology of Time\nBasing Descisions on Abstract Versus Concrete Ideas\t\\\nConstrual level theory:\nThe theory that people focus more on concrete details when thinking about the near future and focus more on abstract meaning when thinking about the distant future\nPredicting How We’ll Feel\nAffective forecasting:\nPredicting one’s emotional reactions to potential future events. These predictions are often inaccurate\n5.4 Self-Regulatory Challenges\nLOQ:\nCompare and contrast the “hot” and “cool” systems for self-regulation\nDescribe how ironic process theory explains why efforts at willpower can backfire\nIdentify evidence for and against the concept of ego depletion\nExplain the interrelationship between self-regulation, self-awareness, and depression\nWillpower: Running Hot and Cool\nHot processes = driven by strong emotions\nCool processes = driven by level-headed reason\nTrying too Hard: Ironic Process Theory\nIronic processing:\nThe idea that the more we try not to think about something, the more those thoughts enter our mind and distract us from other things\nMonitor\nThe effortless mental process that is on the lookout for signs of unwanted thoughts\nOperator\nThe effortful mental process that pushes any signs of unwanted thoughts out of consciousness\nPossible Causes of the Rebound Effect\nPossibility 1: The monitor has to keep the unwanted thought close in order to watch for it - when the operator stops providing alternative explanations the suppressed thought becomes more salient\nPossibility 2: The monitor and the operator require different mental processes — see chapter…\nMinimising Ironic Processing\nStrategy 1: Keep distraction,stress, and time urgency to a minimum when regulating thoughts and behaviour so that the operator has the energy to do it’s job\nStrategy 2: stop trying to control your thoughts when cognitive strain is present\nInsufficient Energy or Diminished Motivation\nEgo depletion:\nThe idea that ego strength becomes depleted by extended bouts of self-control\nGetting Our Emotions Under Control\nCognitive reappraisal:\nThe cognitive reframing of a situation to minimise one’s emotional reaction to it\nImplementation intentions:\nMental rules reminding us to respond to a cue in a situation with a goal-directed behaviour (i.e. if X happens I will Y)\nWhy We Can’t Let Go: Self-Regulatory Perseveration and Depression\nSelf-regulatory perseveration theory of depression:\nThe theory that one way in which people can fall into depression is through persistent self-focus on an unattainable goal\nLEC 3 - Sept 17 — Ward Definitions for Ch5 Terms:\nList up to 5 characteristics of the type of person that:\nyou think that you are\nAngry\nintelligent\nCaring\nGrumpy\na significant other thinks you are (e.g., parent, spouse)\nLoving\nCaring\nGrumpy\nyou think is ideal about you\nMy resilience\na sig. other thinks is ideal about you\nyou think you should or ought to possess\nA better memory\nGreater tolerance for discomfort\nsig. other thinks you should or ought to possess\nJudging our SELF\nThe Self Defined\nSelf-\nWard: a set of thoughts and beliefs that define who people think they are and the way they regard themselves; involving specific beliefs about who you are\nDefining Types of Selves\nSelf-esteem\nThe positive and negative value that one places on themselves\nSelf-efficacy\nHow confident and competent one believes one is\nSelf-control:\nHaving the capacity to resist temptation\nSelf-actualization..\nSelf-destruction..\nSelf-determination..\nWhat are the Processes that Develop the Self-Concept\nHuman interactions, experience\nSocialisation (i.e. gender)\nCultural interactions (i.e. individualism vs. collectivism)\nSocial comparison\nJudgements of others\nAssessing the Self\nEdward Tory Higgins: Self-Discrepancy Theory:\nThe self concept is a function of the interaction between the self viewpoint and the viewpoint of others; and is influenced by (1) how we are (actual), (2), who you want to be (ideal), and (3) your duties and obligations\nA developmental theory of the self – positing that our self concept is a work in progress\nWhere your self concept (the 2 “x”s) is compared to your self guides (O’s)\nX = self concept\nO = comparisons\nNote: O = YOUR perceptions of people’s thoughts about you; not people’s actual thoughts\nWhen there is a discrepancy between the actual and ideal, or the actual and the ought, it prompts us to make changes\nComparisons are not Static – and change situationally:\nView of self + other — there would be times when you’re thinking about the ideal but not the ought, or the ought but not the ideal\nHow we see ourselves now are not how we see ourselves always\nThen how do we set our goals?\nOnce we “get there”, we make adjustments, and obtain new goals, and repeat the process over again\nWhat do Comparisons Produce – emotional responses:\nGUILT = SC<ought/own guide\nI would feel guilt when my self concept is less than my self-ought/own guide\nSHAME = SC<ought/other\nI would feel guilt when my self concept is less than my ought/other guide\nPRIDE (low) = SC<ideal/other\nOnly I can feel pride\nI would feel pride if my self-concept is less than my ideal/other guide\nSELF-ESTEEM = SC>self-guide\nWhen your self-concept is greater than your self esteem, your self-esteem could be either high or low (but likely high because of self-serving bias)\nHIGH = SC = self guide\nLOW = SC < self-guide\nBased on these comparisons, the thoughts we have about them affect our emotions, which in turn affects our self esteem….\nSummary:\nSelf-concept is important\nIt may be a function of differences between our self-concept and self guides\nThese discrepancies feed our self-esteem\nAnd the way we feel (incl depression)\nHas implications for social decision making + the way that we interact with people\nProtecting the Self\nInformation processing (what we let in)\nSelf serving bias\nFalse consensus effect – tendency to think that everyone thinks like us\nFalse uniqueness effect – tendency to think of ourselves as special and unique\nFalse consensus and false uniqueness may operate in opposition to each other\nImpression management (what we let out)\nFalse modesty — using disparaging comments in order to elicit reassurance from others\nExcuses — the reasons that people offer to mitigate their responsibility for negative events\nOne of the first + most important judgements we make about other people is to determine who is responsible for negative events\nExcuses come AFTER the negative event (see self-handicapping)\nIngratiation — giving compliments + doing favors for others to elicit positive impressions\nSelf promotion — highlighting their successes and downplay failures\nExemplification — trying to elicit guilt by creating an impression of moral superiority\nSupplication — eliciting help from others through self-deprecating (“humble) pleas\nAkin to weaponised incompetence\nDifference with false modesty:\nFM:\nFalse claims of incompetence\nS:\nfalse-humbleness\nSelf-handycapping — when you sabotage your own potential for success\nDiminishes uncertainty –\nEliminates the possibility for evidence to the contrary of your beliefs\nExcuses then come after — in order to justify those judgements of responsibility\nYou DO this with the aim of protecting the self-concept\nBut the result is often the opposite:\nCh3. The Core Elements of Social Cognition\n3.1 The “Why” of Social Cognition: The Motives Behind Thinking\nLOQ:\nDistinguish three different motivations that guide thought and decision-making\nIdentify when each of these motives guides thinking\nCommon Issue: Information Overload:\nEven simple decisions require an ability to sort through and reason about a complex web of information\nTheory of Lay Epistemology\nStates that 3 motives influence the choice of how certain ‘certain enough’ truly is\nThe need to be accurate\nElevated when there are negative consequences for making a poor decision\nThe need to quickly reach closure\nElevated when thinking is effortful and/or unpleasant\nThe need to confirm what one already prefers to believe\nElevated when those beliefs are central to some element of personal meaning or worth in life\nExemplifying the tendency to confirm what we believe\n“Do you need closure?”\nSummary\n3.2 The “How” of Social Cognition: Two Ways to Think About the Social World\nExperiential System\nAn unconscious, intuitive, and automatic system of thinking\nCognitive System\nA conscious, rational, and controlled way of thinking\nFacilitated Communication\nA technique that was purported to  allow individuals with severe forms of autism to spell out their internal thoughts with the help of an assistant\nThis method was debunked after it became clear that the “thoughts” being typed out were actually influenced by the adult facilitators\nIn the study that demonstrated this; facilitators fervantly believed that they could not have influenced or constructed the thoughts that came out — but the research suggests otherwise\nLikely:\nWas the unconscious, experiental systems of the facilitator that were inadvertently guiding the pupils’ fingers toward each letter in order to spell out meaningful words, phrases, and ideas\nDual Process Theories\nDual process theories:\nTheories that are used to explain a wide range of phenomena by positing two ways of processing information\nCognitive-Experiental Systems fall under these theories\nHeuristics:\nMental shortcuts, or rules of thumb, that are used for making judgements and decisions\nImplicit and Explicit Attitudes\nImplicit Attitudes:\nAutomatic associations based on previous learning through the experiental system\nExplicit Attitudes:\nAttitudes people are consciously aware of through the cognitive system\nImplicit Association Test:\nMeasures the degree to which people mentally associate two concepts (kowala + australia)\nWe now know that cognitive and experiental systems can both produce attitudes and operate two independently of each other\nThis also means that people can have two different attitudes about the same thing…\nPeople’s implicit and explicit attitudes are more likely to align if they feel very strongly about that thing\nI..e the agreement of implicit-explicit was highest for abortion perception\nAutomaticity and Controlled Processes\nFor the cognitive system to override the experiential system we must\nBe aware that controlled processes are necessary to counteract automatic ones\nBe motivated to control thoughts and behaviours\nHave the ability / cognitive resources to do so\nAn example for this would be preparing beforehand for a difficult conversation with a partner if you know your implicit tendency to lash out\nThe Smart Unconscious\nFive Ways the Unconsious is Smart\nThe motives that guide thinking often operate unconsciously\nMemory consolidation occurs during sleep\nUnconscious mind wandering can help generate creative ideas\nIntuition can facilitate sound decisions\nUnconscious emotional association can promote beneficial descisions\nApplication: Can the Unconscious Help with Health Decisions?\nRational descision making is not always fully consious\nWe think of health decisions as extremely complex, informed decisions that are not made lightly – which is true– AND….\nThe intuitive/experiential system may be better able to integrate feelings and emotions with roles in treatment adherence —\nComplex decisions are made by integrating conscious and unconscious processes\n3.3 The “What” of Social Cognition: Schemas as the Cognitive Building Blocks of Knowledge\nLOQ\nDefine schemas\nExplain how priming of schemas influences both our perceptions of people and our behaviour\nDefine confirmation bias and give examples of how it occurs\nExplain how metaphors can help us understand abstract ideas\nCategories:\nMental “containers” in which we place things similar to one another\nKnowledge is Stored in Mental Structures Called Schemas\nSchema:\nA mental structure, stored in memory, that contains prior knowledge and associations with a concept\nScripts: Schemas about Events\nScript:\nSchemas about an event that specify the typical sequence of actions that take place\nImpressions: Schemas about People\nImpressions:\nSchemas that people have about other individuals\nImpressions for a category of people are called stereotypes\nSchemas Can Change\nOur impressions of people change over time and with new experiences with those people\nThe schemas stored in our LTM are similar to labeled file folders in a computer — they all contain the bits of knowledge that make up something categorical\nMy schema of Felicity Huffman (who plays a nice person in a show) might change when I learn she tried to buy her daughter’s SAT scores..\nWhere do Schemas Come From: Cultural Sources of Knowledge\nChildhood, parents, teachers, peers, books, newspapers, magazines, television, movies, the internet\nFrom these sources, we learn concepts of good, evil, honesty, courage, love, hate\nAnd from these concepts/ideas, we determine what matters amd what we value\nRumors and Gossip\nWhite man with knife to black man → 7 retellings (broken telephone) → Black man with knife to white man\nDemonstrates tendencies of listeners to attend to the cultural aspects of the stories we hear\nMass Media Biases\nSources of current and historical events are based on reality — but that doesn’t mean that they paint a realistic and unbiased picture of reality\nThe texas version of a textbook description of the harlem renaissance included an excerpt about researchers calling into question the quality of the literature\nThe emphasis on the notion of dismissal of quality undermines the significance of the movement – and is an example of revisionist history; a source of mass media bias\nHow do Schemas Work? Accessibility and Priming of Schemas\nAccessability:\nThe ease with which people can bring an idea into consciousness and use it in thinking\nSalience:\nThe aspect of a schema that is active in one’s mind and colors perceptions and behaviour at both conscious and unconscious levels\nPriming\nProcess by which exposure to a stimulus in the environment increases the salience of a schema\nAssociative networks:\nModels for how pieces of information are linked together and stored in memory\nChronically accessible schemas:\nSchemas that are easily brought to mind because they are personally important and used frequently\nExample: Mary (environmentalist) is more likely than Jason (fashionista) to notice an electric car in the parking lot\nBut Jason is more likely than Mary to notice Cynthia’s new shoes\nWe better remember events that prime our chronically accessible schemas\nReading about Steve Jobs, if I strongly value honesty, I’m more likely to remember times when steve jobs was honest\nSituationally and chronically accessible schemas work together…\nCan Priming Change Our Impressions of Others?\nThe context in which things/people are described can influence which schemas are primed in those perceiving them\nParticipants who viewed positive adjectives were more likely to view high risk Donald positively, and those who viewed negative adjectives were more likely to view Donald negatively\nFollow up in a larger sample failed to reproduce these effects\nCan Priming Change our Behaviour?\nAdministrator “stuck in conversation” after students were primed with either rudeness or politeness schemas\nStudents with the ‘rudeness’ schema interrupted the conversation 64% of the time (compared to 17% with the niceness schema)\nFollow up studies have shown that priming is more likely to influence behaviour when people are already somewhat motivated to enact it\nApplication: Using Priming to Prevent Infection\nAn ICU experienced a 32% increase in hand-washing when a citrus-smelling additive was sprayed into the environment\nDemonstrates the power of priming and the environment on behaviour modification\nConfirmation Bias: How Schemas Alter Perceptions and Shape Reality\nScary Implication: Negative Labels\nExample 1:\nVince Gilmer: respected medical doctor – murdered his father\nJudge, psychiatrist, jury all assumed he was faking insanity in his incoherent testimony\nWas later found that he had huntington’s disease, which explained all of the symptoms and erratic behaviours\nImplication:\nThat the presentation of his symptoms activated the schemas of the judge, jury, and psychiatrist to the point where they didn’t want to consider other explanations for his erratic behaviour; concluding to attribute it to malice rather than the real cause of the behaviour (genetic disorder)\nExample 2:\nThis is also demonstrated in a study where psychopathologically normal individuals checked into an institution citing common symptoms of schizophrenia\nOnce checked in, they behaved normally\nNo amount of everyday, sane behaviour was enough for clinicians not to view these individuals through the lens of schizophrenia\nApplication: Confirmation Bias and Climate Change\nPeople with strong motivations in the economic sector were more likely than those without, to misrepresent or recall poorly the facts about an environmental conservation documentary\nWhen Objective Information is Used to Justify Bias\nExperimenters and participants alike have a dangerous tendancy to subjectively interpret so-called objective evidence;\n½ Observed a video hannah in her neighhborhood (either high SES or low SES [¼ x ¼]\n½ Observed a video hannah in her  neighhborhood (either high SES or low SES [¼ x ¼] followed by a video of Hannah answering intellectual questions\nWould anticipate the group that did not see the performance to rely on class-based schemas; as this is all of the data they have\nThe group that observed Hannah’s performance rated her much better if she was upper class than if she was lower class\nContrary to what we would hope for the group with objective evidence; that class-based schemas would be ignored and participants would rely on the objective evidence of academic abilities\nBiased Information Gathering\nThe questions we ask are influenced by the information that we desire to obtain\nIn wanting to determine whether someone is an introvert, might ask “what things do you dislike about parties”, or an extrovert “what things are you likely to do to make a party rock?”\nThese are leading questions; intended to sway a response one way or the other\nSelf-Fulfilling Prophecy\nSelf-fulfilling prophecy:\nThe phenomenon whereby initially false expectations cause the fulfillment of those expectations\nTeachers were told that a group of students were on the verge of a substantial learning leap  – based on scores from a test\nThe kids labelled ‘late bloomers’ scored higher than other kids on tests of general abilities\nLater turned out that the ‘late bloomers’ were a random selection; hence the only reason they experienced an intellectual spurt was because the teachers expected they would\nLimits on the Power of Confirmation Bias\nConfirmation bias does not always occur — why?\nIf people’s observations clearly conflict with their initial expectations, they revise their views of people and events\nMore likely if the expected-observed gap is extreme\nWhen people are aware of and concerned about being biassed, they tend to correct it\nWith self fulfilling prophecies; if targets of the expectation know you feel a certain way about them, they may go out of their way to act contrary to this expectation\nBeyond Schemas: Metaphor’s Influence on Social Thought\nMetaphor:\nA cognitive tool that allows people to understand an abstract concept in terms of a dissimilar, concrete concept\n3.4 Returning to the “Why”: Motivational Factors in Social Cognition and Behavior\nLOQ:\nExplain when a prime such as “thirst” motivates behaviour\nIdentify which psychological motive is most likely to come into play when there is a time pressure for a decision\nExplain the relationship between mood and social judgement\nPriming and Motivation\nThe Role of Context and Competition of Goals\nWe know that primes do not lead people to automatically and robotically do what they are told to\nWhat it DOES do is make some ideas more accessible than others\nSubliminally priming the idea thirst will only lead a person to drink more if that person is already thirsty\nExample: When primed with the concept of “elderly”:\nPeople with positive attitudes toward older adults walk more slowly\nMotivated Social Cognition\nThe Need for Accuracy\nCan lead people to put schemas aside and focus objectively\nNeed to Reach Closure\nCan lead people to see events in a way that wraps the world in a package\nPrimacy effect:\nIf people know they need to form an impression quickly, they tend to seize the first piece of info and ignore others\nMeaning maintenance model:\nStates that brief exposure to stimuli that seem inconsistent/out of place with expectations can put people on alert to make sense of their environment or affirm moral convictions\nWhat is adaptive about perceiving inconsistent states of mind as threatening?\nA chaotic, fragmented world can make it hard to sustain faith that there is anything bigger than themselves\nSocial Psych at the Movies – Pi\nMax’s search for mathematical order highlights some aspects of reality and obscures others. The rest of us may not be so fanatical, yet we all use schemas to filter our perception of the social world.\nNeed to Validate What We Already Believe\nBiases perceptions of other people and events\nBiases perceptions of information that is personal\nWhen analysing statistical information, people become more accurate if the answer seems to give them better odds of good health\nApplication: “Seeing” the Play\nWhen people watch competitive sports, they interpretation of controversial plays and penalties is often biased by which team they want to win\nMood and Social Judgement\nMood:\nGeneralised state of affect that persists longer than the experience of an emotion\nEvolutionary Perspective on why we experience moods:\nMay inform a person about statuses of things in an immediate environment\nPositive mood = everything is okay\nNegative mood = something is wrong / danger is possible\nThe result:\nPeople today may be oriented to use their mood as information in their judgements\nAffected by Mood:\nThe content of a person’s social judgements\nHow motivated a person is to engage in effortful information processing\nHow motivated people are to think about people and events\nStudies show that individuals experiencing negative moods focus on relevant details before making a judgement rather than settling on a quick one\nNext Steps: Understanding Social Understanding\nOur cognitive system is highly attuned to:\nRely on memories\nInfer causation\nForm impressions of people\nImagine alternative outcomes to make sense of people and events\nSee chapter 4..\nCh6.

      "content": "Bob should be about teaching 40, should you know research, and 20 should be about administration. So that's partly what I do here as well. I also consider myself an academic. Anybody? What's an academic? Probably heard it before. Okay, yeah, partly. You might publish academic work. Yeah, yeah, that's an important part of that as well.\n\nThat, uh? Um, that yeah, you basically are learning, which even after you form are formally trained, your your learning as well. But in terms of being an academic. How I see that is somebody who's actively engaged in the generation and dissemination of knowledge, those two things that basically I do.\n\nThat's what we do here. We create knowledge through our research and in that knowledge, we try to impart during the courses we teach. So that's essentially what I'm. What are you guys doing here? Who said that to learn okay? I don't really be surprised how freaking I get that answer to why people are here.\n\nOkay, she wants to learn something that's important. There's different Realms of psychology, right? And this is one of the, I think it's the most important, um. The reason the objective reasons will go over that, but what else are you trying? Um, next semester. Yeah, yeah, so you're you're trying to learn something, but this could be a stepping stone to something else, right?\n\nAnd what's that all for? Psychology, intimate relationships, okay? Yeah, okay, and. Okay, minor psychology, and just there's some loftier goal. Um, um. Psychology relates to a lot of the foundation of a lawyer about Avery, even what you'll study at law school. Um, so you have higher order goals that you're trying to pursue very well.\n\nUm, what are the reasons?\n\nMy friend took this course last year, and she told me that I will learn stuff that I can actually apply in my real life. Yeah, sure. Which hopefully you can in a lot of psychology courses. But this one in particular, I would argue, is very relevant how you. Was it close to the parking lot?\n\nDid you park don't have to walk too far?\n\nWhat if I said that the real reason you guys are here? Is? Reproduce. Stay safe! And survive. What? Any takers on that? What if the real reason you're here? Is, it gives you an edge in terms of reproducing. Surviving, staying safe, become doctor.\n\nBelievers disbelievers. And we want to dispute that.\n\nI think that that's a very, uh, maybe. Like, every regionary way of thinking or an instinctual way of thinking? Uh, it's probably like true. Like most things they have, like come true, they made some other stuff, but I think that we're also more than different instincts and more than evolution of data to be.\n\nUm, and I think, yeah, like, it's true in some aspects, but I think, like, oh, it was also more than different things. Okay, just setting everything outside, sure. So, you didn't sort of get up this morning and go. September 3rd good day to get up and get my jeans promoted 2120 social psychology and make that happen.\n\nYou thought it was for some other reason that I'll get some meaning in life or some entertainment. Ah, hello, um, yeah. I believe in what you said. The reason is, uh, we all know that human beings are social creatures, and the more we know about how society and social relation work, the better.\n\nWe can manage our Social Circle, and I kind of believe that in this generation, the new one because of social media. Our social life is not as good as it should be sure, and the more we can learn. The more we can apply to life, the more we can understand other people right and the less judgmental we will be yeah, you know, our life as we know it has changed over our history, right?\n\nAnd it will change again for the future and certainly social media AI. All sorts of things is certainly. Affecting and will affect it more in the future. So that's important so, but tell me something the fact that you didn't get out this morning and say that suggests that? This is if you're not thinking about it.\n\nIt's going on below your level of awareness, and that. Could it be that these are your goals, and you're not thinking about them? Yeah, I think people are getting used to go if they're not aware of all the time, but I also think if it was more complicated in those goals, and they also can act confidently towards usually value these rules because he's a problem, sure.\n\nYeah, there's a lot of nuance. I'm pretty sure. Um, and when you put together all of the intra personal interpersonal environmental factors, you get a pretty good. Array of variables that can affect things, right? So, that's the case, but just because you're not thinking about it because you're not aware of them.\n\nI mean, I'm sure, mostly didn't get up this morning and say, I better get in there and get my jeans promoted, but that suggests that it's happening below your level of awareness. And could we really be pursuing these goals below? Our level of awareness. Are you not somewhat aware of it, if by achieving like an academic degree or diploma, you're there for increasing like your worth as a partner, sure.\n\nSo, in going to class, you're increasing your worth as a partner, and that does directly like influence, like, sure how easy it is right, and you might be surprised like that. I, I agree with you 100, but there's lots of people who pursue these things, and they're not thinking about that.\n\nI mean, does everybody want a Reaper this? And that's changing, right? Uh, to some extent. Seems like there's people that study that. And does that challenge these Notions of evolution? Um, that we have probably what we're about? Reproduction, reproduction, reproduction, which they see as something called Fitness. Um, does that challenge that those theoretical ideas?\n\nIf that's the case, I'll talk more about that and. None of our theories are one to one. Right. This thing here predicts this thing here. Do you never get the perfect? 100 correlation. Between. The only things that correlate 100 is this beer and bulk wave itself. Otherwise, there's injuries of a new.\n\nReady. Um, let's get all of that. And so, there's going to be individuals who don't aspire to those things people who risk their safety and their security in their lives. You take their lives. Right? If that's what I want to be forwards? Um, and so there are lots of challenges.\n\nDoes that mean that the area is not valid as there are exceptions to that, and those are the kinds of things we will talk a little about as well, but there is a lot going on below our level of awareness. You don't have to think every time your heart beats every time.\n\nUh, it's going on automatically to give you life, and it's conceivable that there is this drone survive. Stay safe and produce gets played out over and over again. It underlies a lot of things, um, that we did okay, um. So, if I'm making a board between my God that?\n\nThat you're here to do these things. Then, um, what is the best way to do that? What is, what is the best way to make that happen? If, if we're about reproduction, if we're about safety, if we're about, um, survival. What is the best game to make that?\n\nYeah, um, okay, by watching. So, for sure, that's. That's one way to do it.\n\nWhen you become more people from create relationships, okay, can you guys hear that sound? It feels like the room's going to take off, um. Yeah, let me just see if. Okay, I'm gonna put a sword in here.\n\nOkay, so we can watch. Uh, watch other people. Learn from from that. What up? Ourselves. We can experiment ourselves, sure. Learn from our own experimentation. But what's the best way to? Reproduce. Survive. And stay safe. Um, by socializing, like, like, you go back to essentially the century into animals, you know, they stay in Pakistan groups that adds, you know, protection.\n\nBy having people around, we need to help other people traveling their physical prevention, but also, you know, mentally. Human beings are social creatures, so we want to, you know. Talk to other people you know. Give that serotonins from being with our friends, our loved ones, our families, sure. So that also ties into, like, creating relationships, reducing as well.\n\nYep, how long does a baby survive an infant without its mouth? Anybody know the answer? Got a question? Well, I'm glad you you're speculating, I hope. Some of us don't know that. I'm glad to hear that that you don't know that the answer probably is not wrong. Right from the get-go, you need to force relatively stable.\n\nSatisfactory relationships or social bonds. A handful of other people who gaining context of mutual concerns for each other's well-being or this thing doesn't happen. The best game in town. It is to be social, but that it's more about forming social bonds or relationships. And that's how we make that happen.\n\nUm. So, if these are pretty bold planes, I'm just saying they get they're resonating with some of you. But if they're true, if if we do need to form these bonds and we do form these bonds. Um, and they lead to reproduction, survival safety. What evidence would you look to to support that?\n\nWhat evidence would you like? What would you expect to see out in the world if there's something to this so that the more that my prayers survive the bigger to call them the end succeeded. Okay, so she's into looking at ants, and that's good because their social beings too, right?\n\nUh, probably some people are going to dispute. I'm telling you that a human being is related to an end in some way, and we don't need to get into that. But um, we could look to other things like that, but what evidence would you look for to, um? Her, and then I'm going to come back.\n\nYeah, so I'm gonna give an example in humans. Uh, we studied that people are in groups of religion, they have religion groups that are supporting them. They tend to live longer. They tend to, uh, deal better with problems and circumstances, and they tend to have more babies. Okay, so that should, okay, so?\n\nUh, uh, you can do it through the lens of religion, but that's a group. Yeah, essentially, right? And we'll talk about, uh, you know, I know, informally, you know what a group is, but it turns out of a social psychologist has a very specific definition of what that means, and when you're in them, you would expect to see more reproduction.\n\nYou would expect to see some of these other things more safety of new parents. They are people who are offering to like, help you with dealing with the baby sure. Yeah, yeah. And we can, you know, talk about these things and lose terms, but I would look to see evidence.\n\nTo support these wild claims that I'm making right, and what evidence would we look to technological advancement functional advancement? Once those needs are like. Once the needs of safety, security, and interception on that so we can start with Americans so exciting that, yeah, sure, um. So right, there may be certain things that need to be satisfied needs.\n\nFamous guys, something called a hierarchy of needs, and that's. Uh, evolved itself because the order that he suggested isn't necessarily, but indeed, you have wings. And some of those needs need to be satisfied in order to move on to another. Yep. Another. Um, has clearly degraded. They were off in the pressure anxiety, social anxiety, and they were unable to like, go out and meet people.\n\nAnd now, okay. Hey, who's teaching this course make me not understanding? Yeah, no, that's great. And most people, um? Most people don't, actually. I like. Uh, way of looking at that. We're looking for positive things to support this right, and you're coming out and saying, well, if I'm in a relationship.\n\nI would expect to see this, this, and this, but very few say if I'm not in a relationship, what would I expect to see and you're right, that if being in a relationship is supposed to lead to improve well-being longevity? Procreation. All of these kinds of things, then when we're not in those relationships, you would expect to find the exact opposite of that, right?\n\nYep. You can also see, like, coming from a different discipline, perhaps, um, like in my criminology. Where's the new talk about things like social boundaries where we can see how when people have weak into their salons and parental like friends, consequently back to complete them making. I'm not sitting down the line sure, perhaps not exactly related to.\n\nLike, it's, it's not just about bonding clearly. It's about who you're bonding with sometimes, right? Because some people can, if we support other people, it could be supporting what, right? Um, and so, yeah, there's. But, but still, the general nature of that. These are universals that we see, so let's just look at some of the evidence that might support this.\n\nTurns out. That when we are in relationships, we are happy. Uh, and when we're not now, somebody I know reminds me, it's probably not as computer in that relationship. And just because we should bond with other people, and do doesn't necessarily mean that we should bond with everybody, uh, becoming contact with.\n\nBut yes, so we find the empirical evidence shows that when people are in a relationship, they're happy. Um. Okay, we cope better with the. Um, stresses that life present to us one of the if anybody here is interested in stress and coping or Works in the area, stress, and coping.\n\nIt's a little scary. I did some of this work when I was doing my PhD. Now, if you go to do a listage, you didn't come up with six parts. But one of the findings that clearly is. Showing over and over again. That's the power of social support. It's perhaps one of the most functional forms of dealing with challenges in their life.\n\nI saw their hands up here and okay, so, uh, when we're in relationships, we cope better. Um, married couples have less heart disease and. Um, there's evidence to support data again backing up this claim that we have. And the point that you mention, which is what happens when you get rejected?\n\nAnd um? Interestingly, one of the things that happened is we experience social pain when we're rejected, and social pain is equivalent to physical pain. In fact, it's kind of ripped off the physical painting system, which is there first to help us survive. Um, and the idea behind this is that if relationships are so darn important, if you're not in them, you will feel pain.\n\nJust like, if you put your hand on a hot element on the stove, you feel pain like, take your hand away. Or you might not survive, right? The idea here, being that if somebody rejects you or you reject somebody else, social pain is felt, and it's essentially indistinguishable food, too.\n\nI don't know if anybody who cares have this experience or heard from people, but lots of people when they're the victims of some kind of breakup. One of your First Responses, which is exactly what happens when you're in severe physical cancer. Um, even our language. We talked about a broken heart, right?\n\nThere's all sorts of, um. Physical things that are related to that the message. Bond stay bondage. Don't treat this lightly. Um, so I hand up over here. Yeah, I was gonna say, um. Oh crap! Oh my goodness, what was I gonna say? Yeah, I totally lost my shirt. Okay, I'm so sorry, maybe it'll come back, um?\n\nWhat about behavior? Um, what would we expect to find there, um? So if people, if if relationships are all so important, we would expect you to be able to to form them pretty easily. And we know this. In fact, this there's an amazing tool, two tools that I use in my lab from time to time to form a relationship, and one of those is the fast friends exercise.\n\nSo I bring two strangers into the lab. I need them to create a diet or a group or some kind of a team really quickly, and I can do that in about five minutes, and there's a list of questions that I can give you to ask somebody else, and the same day as you, your book.\n\nBooks you're interested in movies, those kinds of things, and in a relatively short period of time. The thoughts, friends, exercise, um, you can form a bond, but it's easier than that. I can simply say you're in group a you're in group b, you're in group a you're in group B, you're in group hey to be able Bond.\n\nLike that, um, and the and the bees will bond like that. It's that simple, and that easy. And so, that's what you would expect in those situations, and that's what we'll find that human beings can afford bonds pretty easily. Um, turns out nine out of 10 people worldwide pursue marriage.\n\nUh, that would be reviewing that for the first time, uh, and being struck by that. You know, we know lots of people married a lot of people magic relations, but it was really struck by how many people in that session? Um, think about how we celebrate, uh, relationships, um?\n\nRight? When we're if people are signing a wedding and there's an engagement party or a wedding celebration? Uh, babies are born meeting somebody for the first time we celebrated. Um, and that sort of speaks to the importance. Yeah, I've had a question about everyone's listening marriage so much. Why is marriage at like the highest divorce?\n\nYeah, interesting, um? Yeah, it's. It's a really good question to ask, and there's lots of. Uh, reasons for that is a different world now than being a bald world. I, but when I think about the things that I'm going to talk about in this course and what we're talking about.\n\nNow, the best way to think about them is. How human beings were living when we were living in small groups out on the hill. You might think well was that relevant to today, but evolution is slow. It's about change, but it's slow, and life is moving really right. And so, Evolution can't compete with that, um.\n\nBut I, whenever I'm thinking about problems that are rooted in these ideas, I always think of myself being out there in planes, right, and my small with my family and other families. And you know, laying at how important now would be, but there's all sorts of nuance. Right now, um?\n\nBut that would account for that. Why? It's like 50 success rate. We probably still agreed yet. Uh, one of the things is that a lot of marriages end, uh, in the war. But there's a lot of couplings that are not recorded in a formal marriage, right? So there's still a lot of people doing that for gravitation.\n\nUm, all right, so we celebrate them going back to yep. Let me talk about the context of marriage and like forming relationships. But how do we evaluate the quality, or how do we evaluate a triggering relationship? Like, what happened? Yeah. Human read. Relationship with, maybe not all relationships are beneficials.\n\nYeah, absolutely. We'll talk about that just again because we can bond doesn't mean we should and think about the Myriad of relationships that are out there, from romantic relationships to parent-child relationships to sibling relationships to friendships to co-worker relationships. There's all sorts of different kinds of relationships, and you raise an important question.\n\nHow do we tap into the quality of those things. Well, social psychologists and there's even a finer group of scientists called relationship. Scientists who study those very questions they don't want to use you to believe that this is a course in relationships. It's it's part of the idea where they're talking about, but one of my colleagues creating to be a relationship scientist and her supervisor in the world renowned.\n\nRelationship scientists, and so that course is better suited to studying relationships specifically. But yes, but we have ways of measuring the quality, and in terms of satisfaction, the commitment and relationship quality. There are measures to tap into those things. Um, so there are ways like, like a psychologist, would measure anything.\n\nUm, but yeah, you're right. There's degrees of that. There's not, um, uniform. There's variability, and like I said before, just because we have this. Capacity for bonding doesn't mean we should bond. Always or bond with everything right. We have to find the fit that works. Um, okay, uh? How about when we're not in relationships picking up where you left off on your last comment if we're not in them?\n\nI would expect. Things to happen, right? So, think about loss of relationship through separation, divorce, and data, and the more it approaches that we go through in those situations. So, we see again evidence that supports beauty is so bad, uh, think about the billions of dollars in the Cosmetic industry physical fitnesses diet industry.\n\nClothing industry to attract other people literally think about whether our economy is based on, which is potentially that now, right? And so, we spend just literally thousands and thousands of dollars a week. Um, and something I like to. Uh, pointed out at the end. If you're still skeptical about the value of social bonds and the evidence that shows that they're important, how many Hermits do you guys know?\n\nAnybody here Noah Hermit, you know, a Hermit? Yeah, I haven't heard from her in, like, probably, over a year. Okay, but does that person have relationships with other people, like, maybe one. Yeah, I don't think that it's like a very fulfilling day-to-day experience, so somebody who has maybe minimal, like, is there anybody else who thinks they know I'm not trying to challenge you so much, but you think you know what I remember?\n\nYeah. She's off the grid now. Uh, she's definitely going through psychosis episode. Uh, so she's now, uh, overstated music in general for over a year reported. Yeah, but she's hiding from the boss. That's why she's a hermit. Yeah, so these are some pretty unique cases that we're talking about.\n\nThe thing is, it's rare, and I would challenge anybody think about people that you might think of. They might be shutting, or they've isolated themselves or they're running from the law or all sorts of things like that. But essentially, they probably didn't get to where they are like being a hermit and having zero relationships with other people.\n\nSomebody brings food, somebody makes meals. Somebody provides these resources, um, and so I challenge whether you really know anyone who is a Hermes, and even if you can come up with an example or two, it's rare. Yeah, so. Would you? Would it be a bold argument to say that there's no such thing as a Hermit?\n\nPoint like, you know, why do we form social bonds like to? To, what end? Is it like, is it form a bond right away with its mother, right? And, well, that's like, you know, even includes the idea of there being somebody's a Hermit, but I'm even open to the fact that somebody's transitioning now into a non-social life, you know, and not for, uh, legal reasons, uh, kind of thing, right?\n\nI've even opened it up, but I would challenge that you even know a person like that, that they exist. So I guess, yeah, right? But remember, and what we're talking about here is, um, there could be circumstances, right? The world changes pandemics happen, and we have to isolate and hand those things.\n\nBut that's not our nature, right? And this is definitely the book that drone of evolutionary. For sure. For sure. Who isolate and do all those things? Course, they're rare. Do they challenge a theory again? The numbers are, so we're going to get into these things, right? We're going to talk about things, like, uh, if it's all about this, how about same-sex relationships I think?\n\nDoes that all work out? Um, and all sorts of other things like that, right? And there's good. There are variations for that, and they're part of the diversity. I guess another thought I have that for people high intelligence, they seem to be less socially inclined, and so you look like really smart people, like even Isaac Newton, who was like purposely excluded himself from people, and is that because of high intelligence community or less interested in social media, sure, or that he just had Ambitions to and people sort of, you know, he had Ambitions to think about loftier things and people, and you want to spend all this time doing that.\n\nI mean, I don't know, and I don't even know that evidence. I've never even heard that, but I could could believe it. But again, these things that we're pulling up are rare things. Um, and so you don't ever want to use the exceptions. The challenge for supportive fear? It's just okay.\n\nIt's kind of proof of concept or not baby, but it's really not a challenge that, cuz we never get 100% blind-to-one relationship. When you think about the Myriad of factors that come into play that interact at any one time that we can make any prediction that all is really remarkable.\n\nAh, yeah, I know you had your sorry, yeah, sure now, now and then. Now, we're talking about what those health issues. Right, and again, uh, are these things functional or not? So there's Nuance that happens in all of these things, right? So we can use these things to challenge, but just because somebody's biochemistry is not?\n\nUm, what everybody else experiences doesn't necessarily challenge that theory as well, because there's all sorts of nuance because of those kind of things personalities. Um, lots of different things, so these are good good challenges. You guys are coming up with, but? Um, when you look at the thoroscope mostly happens, all going in this direction, right?\n\nAnd there's pretty good evidence to support that. But there's a nuance along the way. Also, uh, depends on what you're doing so. It kind of depends on what you mean by a German. Yeah, yeah. Like, with technology, there's access to social connections for sure, exactly. So, we can just social psychology have to be face to face.\n\nDoes bonding relationships have to be face to face? Uh, and that's a really good question. When technology was starting to come, this technology is starting to come around. Lots of social psychologists asks themselves. That is what we study related to that idea. Now, it just seems silly. You didn't challenge that idea that so many people have relationships online, right, and Charlie out.\n\nThey're able to form, develop, and maintain their relationships without physical contact and face to face contacts, and then there's AIS where regular forming bonds. But AI, which doesn't really think for sure. Yeah, yeah. And, and then robotics now, too, where people be able to farm relationships with robots. Do you know that one Tesco is the AVS, where someone programmed the computer to ask us based on?\n\nUh, based on someone's inputs, and then people would say, just please. Please leave me alone on the computer, but it was like, not sensing it at all. Oh yeah, yeah, so anyhow, but these are good challenges, and and it's what it's done really is. Just opened up the floodgates in terms of.\n\nWow, what are this? And what about that? And so, it's an exciting time to be a social psychologist and be thinking about these communications. There's a button on topic. Okay to turn off and create an automatic report that's problems making it doesn't. No, it's the what it is is the pressure of the circulation system.\n\nIs not against, but let's see how that all goes. Um, incidentally, I will typically go to our two and a half hours, two hours and 15 minutes with a break. But today, we're not going to do that. I mean, trying to get you out of here as soon as possible.\n\nWhat is happening? We're definitely going to be like an hour an hour and 15 minutes. Something like that, yeah? The first part of the question about this because?\n\nIt's an imperfect world. We live in, isn't it?\n\nSomething like, someone's screaming. Sorry, I like your story. Oh, really. But yeah, I mean, sure, I get your point. But again, my point here being these things are, these challenges are in. Do they exist? Of course. Maybe people like that? How do you define what's your operational definition of a Hermit?\n\nIs it the equivalent of a shut-in. There's all sorts of things, but I mean, essentially, we need other people to make this dream happen. Um, and without forming these bonds, it become, um, we have technology that allows us to procreate out of another human being in some ways. Pathways still need DNA?\n\nRight, and you, so they're yeah. How?\n\nSorry, sorry. No, it's not a problem. How about months, right? So, uh, you're suggesting that they don't want to have kids. They might not want to be in relationships. Is that what you're suggesting? Um, sure, and uh, and. But who knows, right? Do they just because you're living a life like that and possibly in celibacy doesn't mean you don't have desire?\n\nUh, that you're not controlling that right, and so, and there, again, it's not ones we want, uh, we are looking for universals. But not everyone, right? Because that's, you know, that would be too challenging for situations. But how many months are there in the world first?\n\nAgain, I don't know what they're doing and how they're. But it's, it's consumable, but again, the numbers are moving in natural relative to the seven and a half billion. Other people around the planet, right you, you, and then you went on. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's so incredible people because.\n\nAnd by doing things with them, so I do think they pulled in their urges or some of them can take like the valley because I don't think yeah. And again, these are really exceptional cases, right? Um, so that would be that my, that would be the evolutionary social psychologist response.\n\nAnd there's lots of ways it took a lot of your point. I was thinking, there's also non social cues that you give to maintain relationships. Verbally communicate. That take a vow to not speak like in a community or even not, I know. Would my brother he's a high functioning autistic?\n\nHe cannot communicate, but I know in a situation if he is uncomfortable by the way he looks and acts, and I twitch lots of non-verbal. So, yeah. So, even though we can't communicate him, giving me a little to you, I feel that relationship where my other sister can't understand those things.\n\nWe I have colleagues, uh, one of my colleagues, um. Uh, and what you tend to when you're constructing people she's often dealing with stereotype race. Yes, hydrogens discrimination these kinds of things. And so, what do we see upon? We're looking at somebody else. There's also another guy's famous. His name is Ackman.\n\nHe has developed this coding system for detecting emotions of people's face, their musculature, their smile, and these kinds of things. So there's a lot that's communicated, and we just know this intuitively because of the time. There's a lot of ways of communicating lots of things. Think about again when we were living out on the Belt and you didn't have language.\n\nUm. Uh, let's if any of it sounds like it's gonna be a lively class, you know, this kind of stuff, which I love. Um, you get a lot out of that, and hopefully you'll. I get the same out of that, but this will be sort of the exchange that.\n\nUm, so with that in mind. If binding is all that important, which I hope people are along for the ride now than it is, what's one of the first things? You need to do? When you're forming a relationship, what's one of the first things we do? Ask them for their name.\n\nOkay, that might be one of the things we do. A first impression. Okay, what's that? Well, basically the way you initially. Show yourself exactly what the other person to perceive you because that first impression kind of sets the tone, whether how that relationship goes in a sense, so it could come off.\n\nSure, you're very like most important impression, yes, but that person, that's kind of what they're going to take away, and that's all they know of you. So that's what they're going to think. Yeah, when we're meeting people informing relationships. One of the first things you want to do, maybe, is form an impression, and it's essentially a general idea about what someone is, like, right, the core things we have in common.\n\nYou might look for things that you have in common, but my mom told the opposite to try. Was she wrong? I don't think so. No, she was. And she's absolutely wrong. Yeah, um, everybody thinks, oh, you're different from you. You complete me. Well, it turns out those kinds of things end the divorce, right?\n\nIt's uh, offices don't necessarily be a trout. Yeah, it's exciting to figure it out. And then it's not exciting, just aggravating. And it doesn't lead to long-term relationships. But yeah, I think that's, uh, so if you're out there hunting, looking whatever, look for overlap, uh, my difference, um? And so, yeah, that that kind of thing, it could be important to discover those things.\n\nI just wanted to have a small point that I think opposites do attract, but it has to be in terms of like interest can be different, and interests can be obviously, because then it enriches your life by experiencing, and you can complete each other. I guess there's, like, I say, there is exceptions, but the evidence seems to show the more overlap.\n\nThe more successful, I think it's most important to overlap in terms of moral value, sure right here. Yeah, and there's people who do work on those very issues, and so. That is important. Um, yeah, so we form Impressions. What's an impression? What are the things that are important in Impressions?\n\nAnd one of the first things impression is general idea of what people are like, or like, um, is based on inferences. I know everybody's heard of that word. Can anyone tell us what it means?\n\nSomeone's wearing, like running shoes that may be like running, or maybe they're athletic. Um, so you're saying it's a conclusion that you might? How about somebody based on? Some information you make, or you kind of said some basalizing that you might assume about someone based on um or the way they hold themselves what they wear.\n\nOkay, some other information about them, yeah. Um, anybody else want to contribute to that? What's the difference? I mean, like, if you like your offering for a social convention, so we'll go. They don't like me, and then you kind of close your impression when pulling sure. Or did you, you might think, uh, you might.\n\nYou might not say something like you based on, sure, right, for sure, um?\n\nSo, it's basically when you use whatever evidence.\n\nYeah, it's, uh, did you want to ask that? You want to say something out? Okay, let's come back. Yeah, so essentially, an inference is drawing a conclusion about somebody or something based on limited data. That's what we do with scientists. Right, I never know something fully. I get a sample, like, learn something about it, and from there, I draw conclusions from what I met the whole scientific process.\n\nIt's kind of rooted in that idea, but human beings do this as well, right? We have limited, uh? A person walks it in there, this color, or that color right away. I know them, and I know what, what, they're all about, right, or they're this side or that side or this culture of that culture, this religion, or that religion, you know what?\n\nThat's all about, right? Not, but the, I think you do. I think we draw infancy based on him and his name. Yeah.\n\nSure, right. So, that's part of the information. Gossip, right? Uh, limited information. So, all of that gets thrown in the hopping, and you learn from that and form that conclusion based on that. So that's one of the first things we do. Another thing we do is these inferences are based on stereotypes.\n\nI know everybody's heard that term before anybody Define it for us. What's a stereotype?\n\nYep. Basically like when a trait or a narrative or something is a slide to generalize a certain group. Or, you know, certain people, sure. Yeah, when we use a characteristic, let's say. Of an individual and use it to sort of draw a conclusion about the whole group of people that that individual might belong to.\n\nThat's one of the things you do the way. I like to think of, and there's like, longer College definitions of all of these things, but the way I like to think about stereotypes is their biases and expectations. Right, more often than not stereotypes or biases. And the rooted in expectations we have alone.\n\nIs there ever a colonel of Truth in The Stereotype could be, but largely they are wrong inaccurate? Right, and so, um, they become biased. And so, we have to be careful. Okay, so. That's one of the first things we do as Farm Impressions. How long we've been in here?\n\nOkay, so an hour and a half, that's a pretty good amount of time. I'm sure you started following the impressions ago. Alrighty, um? And so, uh, let's check in on that. How many people here think they got me nailed? Oh, I know that guy. I know that. Uh, anybody, a couple of people.\n\nOkay, good. Let me go through some questions, and then I want to get some assessment. From you guys. Now you can work. I'm going to ask for data. Okay, some answers to these questions, but I'm just going to list a bunch of questions about me. I want you to respond to them even in your new tablet notebook or whatever.\n\nUm, and then I'm going to come back and do something. Okay, what kind of music do I like or listen? You don't say, I just keep it to yourself. I'm gonna come back. But, you know, don't spend too much time thinking about it. Write down your answer.\n\nWhat are my favorite television shows? Anybody who watches television.\n\nUm. Do I like sports?\n\nOkay, this one you're going to be wanting to be very good. Okay, how old am I? Am I married?\n\nWhat radio stations do I listen to? Hey, I've got Spotify too, but I'm talking about some radio stations.\n\nDo I play a musical instrument?\n\nDo I use a Mac or a PC?\n\nAm I a vegetarian?\n\nAnd last, but not least, am I an outdoorsy kind of person? So, I go back to that. How many people think? Okay, if this guy I sort of got probably 80? Few people 50.\n\nOkay, what kind of music do I like? I'm gonna try and be as honest as I can with all of these with a couple of receptions.\n\nI think both kinds of music century and Western, um. Yeah, I do like a little country. Yeah. I and I love jazz. I, for some reason, I just find any ideas. I sort of always liked it, but for some reason, I really like it. Now, rock, you want to add classic rock to that?\n\nYes, yes, I'm not saying, I'm just saying, um. Okay, it's a classic. I was literally gonna say, like Dad, Rock. Like, Billy Joel, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen.\n\nUm, yeah. I'm pretty open-minded about people. Um, I have a sister, and she's a total music snob when I was growing up. If I didn't listen to her kind of music. I was like making that something like that, but I've been. I've tried to be open-minded, and so, you know, Sunday morning brunch classical music is really quite Pleasant.\n\nI enjoy that again, a lot of jazz. I really like that, uh, I listen to college borderly. I listened to rap, uh, hip-hop, uh? Funk. I have a I have a pretty good, uh, in the days when we had CDs. I had a pretty good stuff up and a collection, but now I start used to have other options there as well.\n\nUh, what are my favorite television shows? I thought medical dramas medical dramas. Did you guys watch the pit? No, oh my goodness. Um, if you don't like blood and cats, don't watch it. But, um, it's like one of the most exciting shows that I've watched in in years. It's about an emergency scene.\n\nAny very. I spent half of it like this, but it was great. Was your hands up? Yeah, house house. Um, like, in terms of older shows, like, I think a lot of, like dialogue, heavy, like, Frasier, or like, they're not from the side, oh yeah, I can't get it.\n\nI've heard of them, uh, and I've watched them, um. Any other one. Yeah. Let's say hi, my new mother. When I came from like those like friends, I'm like, not good, uh, yeah, I, I know, these shows. I've watched a few episodes, they're not my thing, necessarily something like severance, Maybe Seinfeld.\n\nYep, enjoy that. Yeah, maybe Breaking Bad, Breaking Bad. I've only seen. About elements of it that I think it could be interesting at some point to binge on that, so I don't necessarily focus on medical dramas, but I find those interesting in the back there. Yeah, sorry. What's that?\n\nSopranos, yep, watch that. And then, you in front. Did you have? Oh yeah, that's the kind of thing I there's one that's like. Totally me, yeah. What's it? Okay, one more nature documentary. I do enjoy that. I'll tell you what it is Law and Order. And the original Auntie spin-offs.\n\nIn fact, they brought it back, but it kind of sucks relative to the other. Like, almost every I'm a bit of an involved, so to speak by that. I mean, I sleep about two hours a day, so but before I went to bed. I mean, I would watch an episode of lawnard, and I've seen him finding these episodes, and I love that show, so hopefully they get their act together and can make it as good as it was.\n\nBut that's the kind of thing, but I do like documentaries like movies, those kinds of things. I've watched some of these shows, but. Basically, I have a problem with commitment. Um, not that kind of thing, but in terms of, I can't be like on Wednesday night at eight o'clock.\n\nWatching the same show. And I know we can watch things differently now than the old ways, but I have a hard time with that, I'll tell you when shall I love AGC? You guys watch America's Got Talent. I could watch that every night. I can watch a two-hour episode of that every single minute.\n\nThat's a good family hearing for anybody who's interested in those kind of things. She's better enough to really be worried about what's coming down the, you know, the next commercial kind of thing, uh, do I like sports. No pickleball. Interesting. There is something about person pressure. Yeah, hockey or baseball.\n\nI feel like no cookers. Every people that I've talked to whenever they like, is what they always bring it up. And then, whenever they like, it's kind of, like, Andy, um, I do like sports. I played them, um, yeah, in the past, uh? I guess during covet, I dissected my aorta strange thing.\n\nI died from it. I was caught in time, but it's changed my life just before I my surgeon. Just when I left the hospital, I said, well, I'd be able to exercise, he said, as long as you don't do anything strenuous. It's like, well, isn't that like, what exercise is tossing against sitting in my chair and using your remote.\n\nIs that what I do do? And yeah, I've had to change, but I love tennis. Um, I love skiing. I was a basketball player in high school and part of University. So, I do like I, I wanted to play hockey. My dad would not take me to hockey, uh out to hockey.\n\nFor some reason, probably save me a lot, but um. But yeah, I would have loved to have done that. But yeah, I do. I, I enjoy watching more and more. I'm a total Jays fan now at least are very frustrated with legit, but I like watching more than those kinds of things and the Raptor just came out.\n\nUh, okay, uh, how old am I? Did anyone guess old? Okay. Sure. All right. I wrote down the 48 wow guys are just, so you know, I really don't give out bonus points. Uh, so I'm in my 60s. Yeah, so I've only got six few years left here, right?\n\nYeah, um, am I married? I think you're divorced. Okay, she says divorce, but in the long-term relationship. I was going to say no, because you just say you have part-time committing, but yeah. Honestly, um, yes. Ah, you guys don't go to the clubs very often.\n\nYeah, so I am married. And I have three kids, uh? I don't do blame. I have a review. I just don't feel it. I don't Pierce. I don't stamp myself. I don't, and I'm not. There's no judgment there. It's just my way. Sorry about that. But that's how I am because.\n\nUm, I didn't do it for today's exercise. Um, so? What radio stations do I listen to?\n\nBoom 97.3 what is it? Oh 97.3 7.3 these are just numbers.\n\nYeah, so basically that station's on in my car? I do listen to CBC if you guys are not in business. I highly recommend. I hope that's not too political in the statement. But I, I like that, um, radio station. And so, to get my news, that's typically where I live in New York.\n\nI have to admit, I. Just surf when something comes up that I don't like, and I don't even know what station is on. I have. I think I mentioned I have three kids. I have a son, who's 33, and I have a daughter who's eight and a daughter who's 15, and so when you're in a car within the nine-year-old sorry, uh, and a 15 year old, you're listening to Todd Ford, yeah, he knows.\n\nThere's a lot of that going on in my in my car, too, um, okay. What else do you need to know about musical instruments? It's one of my favorite Jazz instruments, but I don't. Saxophone. Love that too. I played in band. Um, in high school, and everybody wanted to play the saxophone, right?\n\nSo, it was like a high value Target, and I was not lucky, but I'll see whether anybody gets it. It wasn't trumpet, but I do love the trumpet. Yeah, what's that goodbye guitar? I do. I'm a hack, but I, I do play it. I have this other thing. In addition to the secondary order of corporations.\n\nAnd so your fingers don't necessarily move the way they used to. So I have moments, right? Piano piano? No, I, my parents spent a lot of money on piano lessons in total ways. Probably get sent me through college. The drums. No, not even really bad. Right, but it is kind of cool.\n\nYeah, um. Yeah, clarinet clarinet now! Maybe my most favorite spring incident trombone? That was my thing, uh am I, uh, Mac or PCC? You look a little bit like I get the beauty of math. Your name is exceptional, but as an academic, they don't support it. So, all my tech people or PC people.\n\nSo, basically, I had to make that conversion to that. So anyhow, that's what I do. Um, am I a vegetarian?\n\nUm, I don't love animals, and I don't hate them. I just know that a lot of them are delicious. I ate a lot of, uh, different things. Um, okay, uh, but I tried in vegetarian because I do believe in a balanced diet and that you can get a lot of things from a lot of things, uh, but I do try to use more vegetarian and my son did it for a while.\n\nAlmost everybody, I hope I might have been anybody, but almost everybody I know is a long term vegan. It just seems to get sick eventually and see how something important. Am I an outdoor temperature? Yeah, that's a very observantage.\n\nI do. I love it. Hey, we have this 17 and a half foot keplerk in it. But, as I age, a hotel room is so much more appealing than, uh, tension of rock in my back, so, but I do love it. I love painting. I love being out. Um, in danger.\n\nOkay, so I don't know how many people have said 80 of the beginning confirmation was definitely right. Less than that Shockers? Um, so you can start a form infection system, so there's some degree of accuracy happens pretty quickly, right? That's kind of interesting, um? Okay, anyhow, um?\n\nThese kinds of things that I'm talking about now are a part of social psychology. Uh, which is what this course is about. Can anybody tell me what that, what the, what social psychology is all about or Define it for us?\n\nUm, so she said the scientific study of how people think about influence and relate to one another based on the actual imagine implied presence is that it? Yeah, that's what I want you to indelibly etch by the end of this course. Because it is ultimately the definition, but it comes from a couple of different sources.\n\nThe one that I view, and there's two, you don't have to copy down these first two, but um, some social psychologists Define as a scientific study of how people think about influence and relate to one another. One of my colleagues, the University of Waterloos Spencer. And another Myers, um?\n\nSort of. Use this graduation. I like this one a little bit because it's like a clicking dirty definition whenever I'm coming up with these academic definitions of things, I want to encourage all of you to, like when you're defining a stereotype, know what their formal definition is, but think of it as a bias or an expectation so quicker sort of.\n\nDefinitions are helpful, but there's another thing that I like. And to add to this, and this is, It's the study of how individuals thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual imagination and provide. Of other people. What does that mean the actual the imagine and implied presence?\n\nOkay, but what about actual? What is actual? What is that actually? Yeah. Uh, in social norms.\n\nWell, based on the actual imagine implied president, an actual presence of another elevations. Uh, that's what I mean by that versus and imagine. I don't know if you guys are like, because I love driving. I like going on road trips, those kinds of things. When I find myself. I get into this sort of Zen state and my my water, along with it's free.\n\nI mean, I'm sure you guys have had this experience really driving, and you're on the 400 system. And then, next thing, you know, wow, I've just been driving for 30 minutes, and I don't remember one road sign, uh, you know, your mind's free to wander, but you may have been processing other things, and so I can get myself all the work document angry oversound by processing imagining the situations.\n\nI can also resolve issues in those situations, so that would be more of that, whether going to imply.\n\nThey don't not hold. That you should wear this sort of jackets inside. Okay, okay, uh? It's related, but you, and then, yeah, okay, um, pretty much I would. I would assume that it would be like the unspoken. Rules are things that are like, meant to be done, like, you know, like people say.\n\nIt's, you should be wearing deodorant every day, or you know, stuff like that, or you should be specifically talking about the implied presence? Yeah. Sure, like some kind of suggestion. Like, so, here's the example. Yeah, you got cutting. It's just another word to suggest suggest, right? So, I don't know if you've ever had this experience.\n\nI love my family. I like being around people, but there's times I like to spend on my own right? Like, if I can get an hour in the house by myself, I love meeting. Uh, where I'm not dealing with all sorts of other matters. I love that, and I'm coming home, you know.\n\nAt the end of the day, thinking, okay, I've got the house to myself for an hour, and you walk in the door and there's a bag, and it's like. So somebody's there, right? It's, I don't know whether the person's there, but they're complied decisions or so. Based on all of these things, this is rooted in something that a diabetic currently would have came up in and said so simple.\n\nAnd yet, so profound, and that is that we act on the perceived rather than the actual, and I found the perceived rather than yeah, so you don't necessarily need somebody there, but it's more based in my perception of whatever it is. And is that important? It is kind of let me give you an example of how that can work.\n\nHow many people can you guys hang out for just a bit more. We got talking too much about other things, so I'm going to be keeping you just a little bit longer. But how many people here? I think that a d is a good grade. How many people expect to get a bean in this course?\n\nYeah, and did you think it's a good grade and you'd be happy with that? No time for modesty? Okay, if you think you gotta be the okay with that, you'd be good, okay. How many people feel if they got to be it wouldn't be a good thing? Okay, I'll be more of that than the other, uh, kind of thing, but isn't it interesting?\n\nThat from this seemingly objective entity of being. We can have different perceptions of what that means. And you can have different implications for whether you're happy, satisfied, or unhappy. Dissatisfied at the end of the year, what does it be? Does anybody know not 70 to 80 70 to 74.9?\n\nIs a b plus a 75? So and and B is 70 to 70, so it's kind of objective. Um, how do you get that? Well, we're gonna go right here. It's a relatively objective thing, but some of you are going to get that grade at the end of this semester, and you're not going to be popular.\n\nMakes you feel good. And the other ones are going to go and have a celebration, you know, and do whatever. And so we can have this seemingly objective, and uh, and our most of our theories are rooted in that idea of perceptions, which is really profound. Um, and uh, I might have some ideas about the way the world unfolds, and if.\n\nYou know, try to assess whether you think, like me, on these things. I'm probably not going to be very accurate in my prediction, but if I can find out the way you think about these things, the way you perceive these events, I have tremendous accuracy in understanding the way the world unfolds.\n\nI just need to find out how you perceive it and don't use the objective truth to predict anything because people are going to see it differently, right? So any of all of this to suggest that our perceptions are extremely valuable, and so this definition here. Here is the one I want you to use.\n\nIt's the scientific study of how we think about influence and relate to one another based on actual imagine identified presence. Um, if you guys haven't gone there. Uh, as Christian, of course, on e-class. That's where I'll do all the communication. Of announcements. Um, I will provide slides for each lecture.\n\nThe slides are relevant relatively up to date. I reserve the right to change them even in the session, but just before I go inside often won't open those links until just before I come into the lectures, and they'll be available there. I don't provide news. I don't have notes, sorry, but these slides are there, but so I highly recommend that you get these slides.\n\nYou can make notes there that you need to definitely take notes. Um, okay. So, what does the course? What's it going to look like?\n\nI'm not sure if I got okay. Here we go. Okay, there's a syllabus there. I think it's fairly accurate. Let me know if you spot anything, um. So, uh, we. Remember, make sure you go to the right e-class expected, right? I mean, I'm sure you'll get access to this one, but I do have two sections in this section C and section A.\n\nYou have to take this section if you're enrolled. In this section, we have two teaching assistants. They're down in the front row here. This is all repaired, you know, she's um. She's, uh, working towards her PhD in the social personality area, so it's not in addition to having an experimental social psychologist teaching us.\n\nYou have actually two Tas who are training to be social psychologists. Um, and so that's really good. I've worked with, uh, Aubrey, a fair bit. She's very knowledgeable on these topics. Um, she will have an office hour on Fridays at 9 00 a.m. Kind of, like, physical, or by appointment.\n\nOkay, so we'll try if you can't make that time and reach out to one of the Tas, and hopefully they could set something up by Zoom or another face-to-face. Is your other ta and she's working with Amy Muse? She's the relationship scientist, and she is studying topics related to that.\n\nShe's in the PHD program, working to work in your PhD and social personality psychology again, very knowledgeable, particularly in relationship things they don't have to come to class. They've already done their Insight 2120 course so, but they will come for exams. And you'll, you can see them at their office hour if you want, so hers is going to get Tuesday at 1 pm or by appointment.\n\nOkay, probably email is the best way to reach out to both of them to make contact if you want to. Okay, uh, there's, uh, the course is going to be offered on eclass. You can read about what it's all about. I don't even know when that is. Um, the textbook is social psychology, the Third Edition at digital update by Greenberg at all.\n\nUm. Now, the way we're offering it is through something called d1d day one digital. I think everybody's opt into this. It costs a I think it's a proc. I use approximately a hundred dollars. I know we have to let you know how much it costs now, and I use approximately because I, I was even given a value of 109 something, but there's no tax apparently on that.\n\nSo, I think it's like a hundred dollars. You get it for four years. Part of that, is this thing called achieve, which has practice exams and things of that? Maybe you don't? We spend a lot of time scoping out achieve, but I think it's probably valuable. Um, what else can I tell you?\n\nThe course consists of three exams, two midterms, and one final exam. The two midterms are worth 30 percent of your final grade. They're just every exam is multiple choice and a short answer, no essay. So, you get a half mark for each correct answer. So, your first midterm exam is going to be based on a certain amount of information.\n\nI'll go over that you get a half mark for each one, so 68, your second midterm 60 items. Your final exam is worth 40 of your final date. You have to write it to the past the course, so that means AE items on that one now, um. For the first exam, there's going to be lecture material, and uh, and chapters you'll process that write the exam.\n\nUm, on the day that's specified, you get about 75 minutes to do it. It's ample time for everybody to write the exam. You put that information away, then you take the next section of the course and it'll section of the course and you'll get an exam 60 items based on just the middle material, just the lectures from that middle section, and just the chapters.\n\nI didn't expect you to go back and relearn the information on the first section. The third section of the course. Um, which will undertaking the final exam includes the same thing, just mostly the material from that middle section in terms of chapters. Um, and the lecture is for a factor is a key.\n\n10 percent of that 40 or one quarter of the exam will be cumulative, but only the lecture material. I don't expect you to go back and review the chapter from the first section, the chapter in the second section. I just expect you to know the lectures. Um, remember? Um, social psychology is how we think about.\n\nInfluence and how we relate to an investment definition and so, of course, breaks down into that. The first section is largely about how we think about our social cognition. Uh, and then the second is how we influence one another. Uh, things like, uh, and y'all will get into that, um.\n\nUh, but then the final section is how we relate. Okay, so those are sort of the three sections. Any questions about any of that?\n\nYeah, so I do. I, I'm not sure whether we'll do that or not. So, usually, what I do, is, is the exams start at the beginning of each class, and you have the two midterms are right in this room. Um, I feel that nobody's sort of ready to learn after an exam, which is too much.\n\nSo, I often will present a video where I'll just say you should check this out. Most of you can split out online, but the first one I will show you is possibly obedience, which is based on the Milgram experiments you probably learned about that in site 10 Japan, which have to do with, um.\n\nAuthority and? Thank you for each of that. Um, but uh, I'll talk more about that at the time. We'll see more record. Yeah, um. So on the e-process. As for the book for the textbook that, like, um?\n\nAre you not sure? Does anybody else trying to do it? Has it worked? Uh, are we illegal? If you guys are able to do when you guys are probably set up, right? Did you make a note of that and? Okay, um, now. I don't offer me having sex.\n\nSo, this is how it works. I really expect you to comment right now. I have a plane ticket. Sorry, I'm not gonna, uh, you need to wait until you find out when using garbage is now, as well as the final examine, I don't even know. But what can you paying ticket until you make the final expenses and you're starting to crack down now.\n\nThe register's office as well for those things. Um, so um, if you do miss because of some medical issues like bereavement or something like that, I need documentation, but I offer one exam period on one day in January, and if you miss one exam, you write it. If there's three exams on that day for exam, the second exam, and the third example.\n\nAnd if you qualify for that exam, you write it down. If you miss two, you'll write them back and back. If you miss three, you're ready, uh, back, but I think how the register's office is taking the third example, but that's how I am. If you are going? Are going to be.\n\nAway, or are you miss? It is 48 hours. You need to send me an email the Tas email if they're going to be managing the bank that exams, so we all need to be, and you can compete what's called the missed exam. Um, and in there, you can stipulate what it is.\n\nThere's information there provide documentation for why that's the case, and just don't automatically think that it's going to happen. It has to be unjustifiable using the point is. Come to class. I understand that sometimes there are issues arise, and there is an mechanism to deal with that. But um, don't just think automatically, it's going to happen.\n\nUm, anyhow, I would encourage you to go through that. It's kind of a lengthy to figure that out through the syllabus. Uh, oh. Also, in addition to the three exams, I offered two units. And those bonus points are for participating in two sanctioned in-class snakes. Uh, probably they take like 30 or 40 minutes each.\n\nIf you complete one, you get one percent if you complete, uh, the second one, you have one percent. These will be social psychological in nature, so I do like to give you this bonus point opportunity. I do it so you can see how, uh, social psychological research is that, more often than not, it's a graduate student for an undergraduate student doing an honors thesis.\n\nUm, and uh, you can sort of see how they're doing that. It's often online. But it is conceivable that you get 102. It's, it's rare, but it happens. Okay, um? What else to tell you there, just if you scroll down, you're going to get the exam schedule.\n\nHere. So, just to give you an idea?\n\nOkay, just to go over there so you can see. For example, the first exam is going to be all the lecture materials, including today, until the lecture before the first exam. The first exam is going to be on October 1st, uh, it will be in class paper and pencil.\n\nYou need to bring your ID film dismiss that I don't need that. I'll just bring my driver's license. I'll just bring my. Health card that's not sufficient, and you should check out what you need to do on my social media. Uh, and you have to show with that. Um, and then the here's the various topics and the chapters will include one, two, four, five, three, six.\n\nYou can see the order here. Um, that's the order I want to talk about that stuff. Do I lecture on everything in the chapter? I know it's, I don't see the course as a regurgitation of what's in the textbook? I supplement the textbook with my lectures, so both are important, but that first exam is going to be based on lecture material as well as textbook.\n\nMost of it's textbook, I would say 2/3 from the textbook and one third from the lecture material.\n\nUm, don't underestimate how much? If you wait till the two night or two before, you're gonna get a shock. And you know, that's right, studying your first year, uh, but it's it's a lot, so I would encourage you to start now. Probably mostly are taking five courses, so it's this time spot.\n\nSo, keep that in mind when you're preparing, and I would recommend that you come. Uh, so that's multiplied two more times right through the middle section in the final section. Any questions about any of that? They don't have time percent of one to six lectures as a community. No, no.\n\nSo, the first exam is going to be based on this material, file it away. The next section of the course is going to be on just the chapter from the middle section and just the lectures from the middle section. Then you're going to file that away, and then you're going to learn the final set of chapters and lectures, but the final exam is going to be largely on that third final section, but there is a cumulative component, but only the lecture material.\n\nSo what I do is I typically go back to the first lecture, and I generate two items next one, two items, and so on. You get that number for emails. Do you want all the TV and feelings? It's helpful if I if they need to be an agency. The email is the best way to my office hour is Wednesday today at 10, 30, or by agreement.\n\nUm, I can do Zoom Marissa a lot of times. Issues can be done. So, let's start with that. If we Zoom is a some flexibility, but I'll also be in my office in my office. Sorry, this will follow. Do you want, uh, the header, our horsepower? Sure, it's helpful.\n\nWe have got two sections. Yeah, that's what I think so. I need any details. I mean, you, you'd be surprised. I get, hey, you, hey, uh, I got. I had this issue, and it's like, I assume that I know who the student is, what more? Yeah, I got a lot of students, um, going on.\n\nSo, give me Jr, and, uh. Any other questions about Indiana? Um, yeah.\n\nI, if there's something called achieve as well, that comes part of that. Uh, it's got like practice quizzes and other information. I don't go through that, but I think the supplements is very powerful. Um, people have asked, can I use it earlier version? I don't write what the exams my lectures and everything are based on this textbook, so, if you use something different than that, maybe run a risk.\n\nPeople, you said, what about another? And getting the right information. So I, this is where the information is. I recommend you go there to get that, uh, to study and do all those things I know. It's expensive to do these things, but I was just talking to Aubrey Builders earlier when I was an undergraduate when there was dinosaur running around, my textbooks were a hundred bucks a minute, so that's pretty good.\n\nI mean, the hard cover went just formata. A lot of them are two fifty three hundred bucks, so it's probably my advice.\n\nOkay, and the other side. Now, somebody's asked. There's a couple of people who reached out about note takers if anybody's interested in doing that. I'm not sure if it's a voluntary thing, I think it's probably unpaid. You can reach out as voluntary. Yeah, so if anybody's interested in doing that, what a great thing talk about evidence.\n\nAnd it also been very helpful to people, so anybody's willing to participate in that you can reach out to the United States. Information on them. Leaders think of anything else. Um, I hope that our discussion happens like today, that it's respectful by even if people say things that maybe you might bring John or whatever.\n\nI don't think anybody in this class will do that, but I always expect them to be mutual respect. The other thing is, um, remember, this is site 2122 a. It's on dinner theater. We have our break. I don't mind up bringing coming back, try not to bring back food.\n\nYes, the whole room has to sort of a job. It's mostly for my, um. You know, Afghanistan, um, okay? Another question if I have a scared jobs, please?\n\nWell, I'm gonna try in. I, I don't know what's going on there, uh, I gotta email the book wrap and find out why I'm not getting access to that, so I'll do that as soon as I go back to my office right now. Then it will send out, and it's mean class announcement.\n\nAre you guys still getting like an error code? Where, like it says, that you have to create an account I have that accessible, but this is also asking for the course. ID, yeah.\n\nThat's what they were saying here, so I don't know why that's happening. I'm gonna have to go back now to talk to the warcraft. Yeah, yeah, good, so I might, yeah, be awesome. Seeing you guys on that Communications and I'll send out right now, you know, um, I'm just wondering, because I know, yeah, I have a video, too.\n\nSo, I'm wondering, if is, that, is the exam going to be like the examiner of the video later. Yeah, during the class. Yeah, so if I wanted to like, for example, book with, like the exam Center, or something like that, yeah, how, like, I guess, because I would get time and a half.\n\nFor example, it's like I can just watch the video later. Yeah, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's how I would either make it available. Or, and I'm not even sure whether I'm going to show it, okay. So, just so you know. Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, yeah. Thinking about that, get in touch with me.\n\nLike, I'm gonna get a document myself for sure. Yeah, thanks.\n\nSo, actually, I took a picture of your attention here.\n\nYeah, I can take it off right now.\n\nI, I just. I'm just aware of everyone else.\n\nTell me.\n\nWell, I guess.\n\nYo hello! You doing man, how's your summer right? Awesome! I missed you. It is. Down my job to make sure you sign in gotcha. I see, I'll catch all. I'm gonna go pee guys. No, no fried rice. This time, I'm switching it up.",

      "content": "What I'm hoping to cover and then dig into what it is that I want to cover just a little, uh, heads up sometimes. My what I'm hoping to cover in a lecture I don't get through. It's a little bit too ambitious, so essentially, wherever I leave off. I will pick out the next time is we will get through all the information by the end of.\n\nDon't worry about that. Um, I just wanted to check in the textbook. I don't know if you guys have been successful. Uh, yeah. And just to remember that it's, it's this often option, right? Sorry, off out option. You're automatically enrolled to the registers office. You have to opt out of that.\n\nUm, there's also this other thing called achieve, where I don't know much about it. I don't spend that much time on it, but I think it's helpful in terms of processing the information it's in there. I know some people they actually design quizzes and that their your grades are dependent on that.\n\nThat's not my strategy. I want you to have access to it. I want you to have freedom, at least within the three sections of the course, to do practice quizzes all of those things. Um, but for your own edification, right? So you can monitor your own progress. Um, the guy who's my book?\n\nRep is apparently designing all that and pulling it together. I don't know whether he's made progress. I know from one of my sections he has, but it's in the works. Yeah, just like, anecdotally, like, I find the achieve quizzes. Like, really, really helpful because they tell you like, you know, what percentage of the questions that you got wrong were like, based off of the topic, so it's like what you need to go study more.\n\nIt's really it's like metacogue, it's those kinds of items, particularly the multiple choice, because that's the items that, uh. That's the technique format I'll be using to monitor you. But my guess is, if there's short answer and essays, it doesn't hurt to play around with the information a little bit right to figure that out as well that it's something about.\n\nUm, so with that in mind, I just want everybody here to keep your eye on the ball being down tall and the first one I believe is in October on October 1st, uh, it's a Wednesday. Obviously, it'll be in this course. I'm sorry. In this classroom, uh, it will include 16 multiple choice items that will be based on chapters one, two, six, as well as all lectures from the first band class until the lecture, right before the end of the lecture right before.\n\nHey, I need to show up here, right on time to the exam gets started right away over 75 minutes. What kinds of questions do I ask? I'm interested in your knowledge of Concepts, constructs, definitions, theories, empirical findings, research findings within there. I'm not interested in things. Like, what day did this happen or what, uh, you know, memorizing dates or people's names?\n\nI will use dates in people's names, though, but it's more as a heuristic to help you recall something. Um, I would never say who came up with this Theory and gave you four names. I would more. I'd be more likely to say, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah's theory on blah, blah, blah.\n\nThey sort of, you know, concluded this, this, or this, are they predict this, this, or this, something like that to help? Okay, don't leave the reading until a night or two before you're gonna get shot. Uh, I, I don't think it's any different than any other course you're taking, but don't underestimate how much reading is involved.\n\nHow much processing of the information is involved with six chapter plus the lecture material. Thanks a lot, so you got to keep on in each week got to create a schedule. And you know, I'm sure you guys know that, but it's important to, uh, to? Remember, approximately two-thirds of the items will come from the textbook and approximately one-third will come from the last year material, and you'll see that my election material sometimes overlaps with the textbook, but it's there to supple supplement that not to sphere to data.\n\nAlso, I'm using E-class, so you know you guys can follow on there, um? This is probably going to be a writing lecture, so you may want to grab a little bit. Uh, and then what do I want?\n\nIn today's lecture. I'm hoping to get through all these topics. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get through theoretical perspectives, but I want to talk a little bit about the history of social psychology, and I want to delve into research methods, which hopefully will be reviewed for some of you, some of you might be just taking research methods now.\n\nIn your second year, taking a specific course on that, I'm going to give you a crash course on Dom and social psychologists we use, and then I'm going to, um. Get into theoretical perspectives. I don't want to lead you astray and to believe that there's only three research methods that associates there's more, but these are Dominicans one.\n\nI don't spend a lot of time are qualitative methods, but it's like an amazing method. Um, I'm very important, uh, in terms of theoretical perspectives. I also don't want to lead you to believe that there's four theoretical perspectives that are using for psychology. There's a lot. These are dominant ones, and in fact, the best way to think about these are as families of theories, there's several learning theories.\n\nThere's multiple consistencies and balance theories, attribution theories, and exchange and actually theories. So, these are more like families and just some examples. Okay, um, I'm sure everybody here has heard the term. Don't reinvent the wheel. Yeah, what is meant by that? What do we mean by that? Yeah, like, don't make like a process more complicated than it needs to be.\n\nOkay, so don't make a process more complicated in these three. Yeah, kind of related. Yeah, maybe, like, stick with what's proven to work. Yeah, right. Stick with what's proven to work if it if it ain't broke. Don't fix it kind of thing. Okay, any other? Interpretations don't reinvent the wheel.\n\nYeah, and you should expect sure, right? Um, and, and so, that's sort of why we might engage in that. It's a possible waste of time. Is it like Arkansas? It's very easy, but we have more easy solution, right, are minimized. It's kind of related to that. There's minimization of that, too.\n\nIf we don't, now we have to be careful with that, right, because somebody might have thought they had re hadn't vented the wheel, and it's pretty good that when I attach it to my cart, it goes. It makes it easier, but the wheel is elliptical, right? And so, the car does this when you're pulling it along.\n\nAnd there is a better way to, uh, to design, uh, around your wheel, though, cuz we have to be careful that we don't simply abandon things in that process, but it's really important in terms of not wasting our time. Um, you know, we want to become masters of our universe.\n\nAnd and have a. And deal with a scarce set of resources. I think last week I maybe mentioned the area of stress and coping, and just how it's burgeoning as an area. There's literally tens of thousands of barrels. And it becomes very difficult to assess the history of that area, right?\n\nBecause even in your, if you started out in your roots and stress and coping. There's no way in your lifetime, probably in this whole groups lifetime that you could read all the articles and reproduced on that, and so, how do you not engage in Reinventing the wheel, right? What does colossal ways if you come up with this really great idea, and you would come up with it 10 years ago, and you didn't know about that and wasted all of those resources, and so one of the things that we need to consider in any field.\n\nIt's not considered that often, but is resources, right? It's not just unlimited, you can't, just so we have to really assess what's been done. You know, get a sense of it, and then move on from there. So? With that in mind. How old is social psychology? His oldest time.\n\nOkay, she says, it's all this time. Social psychology is. Yeah, I feel like social technology has been there for us ever since. I think I'm the reason, but okay. They didn't really start your life so that social psychology until like, later, sure. Okay, so if we think about, remember social psychology, how we think about influence and relate and one another based on the actual imagine implied presence of other people.\n\nThat thing I want you to expose in your minds. That definition has that been going on forever? It has. Yeah, we. We've studied ourselves from the get-go or. Um, more like in the United States Physicians the early 1900s. Okay, you say the early 1900s? Okay, so he says social psychology didn't become social psychology until the early.\n\nLike, I think, right, how many times you? What is what you're saying? You can always exist when they moved into the console, I guess. Okay, and maybe we're, uh? Maybe we're not thinking about the same thing here. I'm presuming that people said since the beginning of evolution or since the beginning of time or whatever mean that we have been studying ourselves in this whole process.\n\nAnd remember, how fundamental this thing is that. That's probably the case. What you're talking about is maybe something a little different, I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. Uh, the formal study of it, let's say, or the systematic study, uh, I don't think either are wrong. I think it depends if you're considering one of the words to it or just be made.\n\nSure. Yeah, so if we're thinking about more formal documentation, those kinds of things, yeah, the earliest studies were in around the 1900s. Um, when, when did psychology start? Even before time. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So, when did when did psychology start?\n\nYeah. I guess her argument is, it's the same. It's always been around okay, and it's like, technically, we didn't have a name for it until Troy and Floyd is psychology. Yeah, a little bit even before that, um. Looking good idea. So you're saying it's not necessarily when we play games with like when someone like first considered what is issue in mind.\n\nWhy are people how to do sure? I, I mean, I'm just, I don't know the. The answer to this question fully, uh, I think you guys are right about that, but there's probably we were thinking about these things a long time ago and have been studying it. When your grandma probably has some good ideas about, you know, social psychology, she might not call it.\n\nThat, or your parents might have that, and they've been studying people for a long time. But there is a formal study, and if we, when with psychology? Started or began well in human, independent discipline. In the late 19th century, okay, but we can see, like the whole movement of, like, moving to North scientific methods in general started with the AIDS of Enlightenment, which is like, sure, 18th yeah, science is pretty modern, uh, in terms of the history of human beings.\n\nBut yeah, I mean, does anybody? Everybody here is taking 10, 10, right? You wouldn't have gotten in here. Apparently, if you didn't have that, um? When did psychology start I need to remember when and who started it?\n\nBut there's this dude. I don't have heard about about it, the name deployed. Oh yeah, I heard about him, but there's a guy before that too, his name's bunt bunt, uh, German enlightened in 1879 or something. Well, yeah, so? That's when one of the first Labs was established in Psychology.\n\nSo, if social psychology is sort of an offshoot of that, probably it's a little more modern than that. And in fact, one wasn't even a psychologist. They didn't have them then, right? He was a he was a medical doctor. Um, and the methods they used all sorts of things, but they started introducing ideas associated with psychology.\n\nUm, but it's, it's certainly older than that. In fact, um, you raised the early 1900s, one of the first textbooks that was published was in the 20s. Um, by a guy by the named Mickey, and it was all about instincts. Why do we do the things we do because we have this innate, uh, we're born to do these kinds of things that was sort of a strategy.\n\nBehind those books, and then. Uh, a lot of what we know about psychology, sort of, came out of the first and second second world war. Um, uh, and so. There was, uh, that's sort of one of the key time periods that, uh, you keep in mind in terms of the formal study of site College, um, but?\n\nWho said that? Yeah, Aristotle, Aristotle. Some Greek dude way back in the day, right. Long before 1879, they've been thinking about it, but long before that too, right? Um.\n\nLong before that. People have been studying. How we think about influence and relate to one another based on the actual adding implied presence of others, not necessarily with that definition in mind. Now, over the years, we've learned a fair bit. Um and, and uh, but there's been changes in the formal study of psychology.\n\nUm, and I want to talk a little bit about those changes. There's been changes in the focus. There's been changes in the issues, the participants, the research methods, the types of analyzes we do. Um, and so we've done a fair bit of work already in terms of formal, systematic study of social psychology and psychology.\n\nIn terms of changes in Focus. Um, initially, uh, social psychologist focus on instance. Um, these, and we do things because we're born to do them, essentially, what's? Uh, their approach to that. Then, we moved into studying attitudes. I'm going to be talking about a lot of these constructs as we move through the course.\n\nUh, but attitudes are sort of a Cornerstone of social psychology. Uh, and have huge implications. And despite that, there's still lots of work going on on attitudes. Then, we moved into an area where we were interested in consistency, consistency in terms of what people are thinking and doing, and uh, and this progress into attributions.\n\nThese things again. I will spend time on throughout the course. But attributions are essentially the reasons that we come up with. In terms of why things happen, just like a scientist, human beings are always trying to figure out. Why did that happen, right? So that they can help themselves.\n\nThey can control situations they can manage better. Um. We've then moved into areas of social cognition, which is essentially just thinking about ourselves and other people. It's a little bit more complex than that, but this first section of the course really rests on that notion, uh, and of dealing with things like automatic processing of information, so you probably know a little bit about this, but it turns out there's a lot going on below your level of awareness that actually have has an effect on you.\n\nUm, and so there's people that study that you can imagine that's kind of complicated when we're trying to assess these things in people. Because if I don't know what's going on, how are you going to measure that? How are you going to find out what's going on? I don't.\n\nI can't even tell you that it's going on, but we have our ways. Uh, we can tap into that, uh. Most recently, there's been a lot of work done in neurosocial site. Uh, culture is huge. Religion is huge and also best research practices. A lot of they call a lot of science.\n\nIt's not just social psychology, it's not just psychology science. A lot of scientists have sort of lost their weight in terms of the scientific method, which we're going to go over today and have been sort of more abusing it rather than using it. And drawing conclusions that really are not valid, not reliable as of our method, so there's a lot of people studying our best research practices and questionable research practices and the effect that test.\n\nUm, there's also been. Changes in issues. Uh, again, because of, uh, what happened in the second world war, which a lot was rooted in Prejudice? These sort of unjustifiable, negative attitudes we have towards individuals or groups of people. So, there was initial studies in the social psychology were called Prejudice.\n\nIn the 60s, we started talking about aggression 60s and 70s. And then dry it into the 60s and 70s as well. Crying with any culturalism again is a big popular topic right now. As well as morality and religion. These are important topics that we attract over the course of studying social psychology.\n\nThere's also been changes in our participants. Changes in the gender of our participants. Um. Does anybody know? What the gender distribution is? A lot of psychological research. Mostly men. Um, well, it's it's interesting. There's there's been changes, right? So, in the early days, most of the research was done on him.\n\nSo, in, like, you know, in the? 50s, 40s, 50s. It was done. I mean, why would that be the case? Okay, when we think about, uh, psychology, and the study of it, probably a lot of people think, well, it goes on at universities, and you're saying that in those days, only men went to University, and there's truth to that.\n\nThey were, in fact, women weren't allowed in many respects. They were excluded, and so if who you're trying to study is even generally human beings, and you're in an environment where there's only men there, you tend to think that's the received view, right, that only they know that. Yeah, I think our doctor can also mention that most of her studies who are on women, yeah, married women, yeah, and so he may have, uh, actually broken.\n\nThose and man, remember, this was when well before. There really were psych departments and. People were studying social science, the opposite of what she said. Yeah, exactly. The studies were mostly on men. Yeah, in Ford's case, it was mostly right, and he was probably studying more individuals and doing like case study approaches where, when we started looking at larger sample studies men were the focus.\n\nSo, for that reason as well, so there's lots of issues to work in here. But then, actually, it started swinging. That um? In the early days now. Now, what's interesting is that even though men dominated universities and that's what we tend to think accounted for, the focus on men, a lot of the research actually went to the communion.\n\nAt they, they didn't have participant pools, right? You guys know the undergraduate research participant pool the urpp. And, uh, but a lot of that. That's kind of a new idea. In the early days, they didn't have participant pools, and so they went to the community. And they still studied math.\n\nThey didn't try and study women in those situations. Yeah, get a part of it because they were more in the vulnerable population, like in prisons, or they were like soldiers. There's lots of different reasons that can account for that, I think yeah. Yes, to all of those kinds of things.\n\nBut there's also because they, at that time, they thought men were the receive year, right? They were the dong, and so if you want to find something else, go study men about that. How wrong that was, right? And there was no difference in perspective, or that they represented everybody and.\n\nThere are some studies afterwards like antisocial personality disorder, like a function. Yeah, um, like racial wise, is more men than women, so they're probably more the focus of study, right? Right, and for the all of those reasons, that was the focus. But then, it's switched. Anybody know? So it's switched from.\n\nGeneral, uh? Population to to college students that that was a switch that happened, so we would go to the community. And then, as things progressed and we found out how difficult that was. Let me tell you, although there's challenges associated with using like a site 1010 group of people.\n\nIt sure makes research much easier. I've worked in the environments where you actually had to go solicit individuals. It is painful, slow, um, awkward, all sorts of things. So even though there are challenges, it really changes things in terms of training people. How to design this commissions, but also in terms of understanding a phenomena.\n\nBut of course, we have to appreciate that if our sample is based on 19 year old site 1010 students that there's limits to what we can conclude, who we can generalize to in this situations. But initially, we went to the community. Then, we. Progress towards college students again because it was convenient and easy.\n\nThey started creating those tools, but the focus was largely on men, and then it switched to women. Which is kind of interesting, and I don't know why that is, but psychology went through this process of becoming feminist. Um, when I was sitting in my site 1010 class, there was a sorry.\n\nIn my 2120 class, there was about 50 50. Uh, and I bet you if I would get you guys to stand up. Don't worry about it right now. We'll have other opportunities where you'll stand up and represent, um. You, and if you just simply look around, my guess is that it is about 50 50 in this class, but I spent a couple of decades at York, where there'd be 100 students out there.\n\nI'd get people to stand up. There would be 90 women and 10 guys for years and years and years. Do you think part of that is like a sort of like course correction for, like? Because like because psychology like sort of started out like, obviously, like, you know, pretty much only like only dealing with like research in men and then sort of like when?\n\nLike when increased opportunities, I guess, became available. But like, there was sort of a degree of. Like, I, I don't know, like, necessarily, like if it had to like, explain it. But, like, do you think there could be? Yeah, like, course correction, I don't know, he's a compensation. Yeah, and I don't know the answer to that, uh, we can speculate on that, but you know, nursing was the same way.\n\nDo you know what one point nursing was a male-dominated profession? Then, it became a female-dominated profession, and guys didn't want to do with them right. And now, it's sort of coming back again, but psychology followed a very similar fate, but it was very male dominated and then all of a sudden it became female.\n\nUh, dominant, and less. But now, the pendulum is swinging again. I, I can't tell you why that is, but it has. And of course, if you're using, uh, site 1010 sample, and it's female dominated. That's going to be the majority of your participants now, even though if you look out here, you've got about a 50 50 split when I do.\n\nMy studies and I use a broad range of samples, but I do use psyc 1010 students. I still get about 70 women. Why is that come on? Guys, you got to show up to these studies, right? Like, it's, it's volunteer. You can get credit card, but you don't show up for whatever the reason is.\n\nI'm not sure why this you're too busy. But more women show up and participate and earn these points in these situations. So I don't know what the answer to that is, other than it has changed. And of course, it affects. Um, what we find, and it also affects the conclusion that we draw now.\n\nWhat is important in terms of your credit scenario? You got your hand up. I'm going to come here. I, in terms of criticisms. Um, it's important to appreciate that if you're just getting a life. Of course, we have to be limited in our conclusions. We can draw from there, but it really, um?\n\nIf there. If your theory doesn't make any prediction about, it's going to happen for 19 year olds, like 10 students going to happen for 60 year old. You know, males, or whatever, if there's no reason to believe they're going to behaving or feel different, because that thing it doesn't matter and you need to appreciate that, right?\n\nUh, you shouldn't just use it. Well, it's a it's a site 1010 sample, so it sucks. We can't conclude anything, but that's not true. But you have to be a critical thinker of that and knowledgeable program. Yeah. Something that we talk better. Yeah, the introduction of like education and our developmental profits.\n\nSo, which were more like tuition? Yeah, absolutely. So there's lots of courses acting on this, I, I. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it's one of those things, but things change and our samples have changed as a result of that and reflect those changes. I don't know why the pendulum is swinging back again.\n\nI'm glad it is like, but it was. It was kind of painful in some of those years when I would get talk about these issues and there'd be like 10 guys in the class to find out in my day, you had to take a course like psycho women, you know, and there'd be like three guys in the clocks and the rest were women to get those kinds of numbers, but Um, and yeah, it seems to be shaking out again nicely, which is great because the issues are important.\n\nUm, also, what are some of the other issues. So, in addition to site 1010, that one that's sorry for the, um, previous thing that we were talking about, can it be because, for, uh, for a while, I haven't? You know, that was so long, but um, I could see that, um, guys were resentful to its psychology.\n\nFor some reason, it's it's even through going to a therapist. They were, like, very, oh yeah, I don't want to go to a therapist. I'm not, you know, crazy, or something like this sure? Can it be a reason why they wouldn't, um, participate? Sure, they might be self-guarded shy.\n\nAll sorts of things not that I represent, but all of those kinds of things right might not want to, you know, admit there's an issue, and if they might not want to talk about it and. Um, it's a possibility, um. You'll notice I have M Turkers there. Does anybody know what that refers to M Turkers?\n\nYeah, it's like an online like research pool where I think it's like an online research, an online conversation. It's a crowdsourcing pool, so people criticize like 1010. They criticize lots of different things, and somebody came up, uh. Amazon Mechanical Turk and there turns out, there's a whole bunch of people out there who want to just do studies.\n\nIs it all day and respond to questionnaires to make money for it. Not a lot, but this is what they do. There's others, so there's, uh, they're called M turkeys. There's also another one called prolific. It's run out of the UK, and they tend to have samples that are a little, uh, a little more diverse, some mineral older, so you know, your site 1010 student is like 19 years old, blah blah.\n\nBlah has all these characteristics. Tim turkers are the same thing, but there's people who have criticized this, too, just like they criticize psych 1010 students, essentially being a psychology of site 1010 students. But now, it's like the m turkification of psychology. And why does that matter what I find?\n\nUm, so in in Psychology, we are interested in relationship between variables. This thing here is going to predict this thing here, but the thing that fascinates psychologists, the most particularly social psychologist, is why, why does this thing here affect that thing there? And that's our Theory. Um and I find with M turkers, um?\n\nWhen they're doing a study, they quickly realize what it is that that studies about, because that's what they're doing all day. They're like professional participants and their experience, and all these things. So, when you're testing out an association question, this thing here should positively relate or negatively relate to this thing.\n\nYou get confirmation of your hypothesis, but when you're trying to measure. That doesn't happen because they're not putting the time and effort into thinking and feeling the way you want them to think and feel in those situations. They're simply saying, oh, this is what this guy's interested in right, and I'm going to give him what he wants because I get a rating in terms of my quality, and I make more money when I'm a good participant and a good participant confirms my hypothesis, right?\n\nUm, also, like, obviously personally, when I was doing all those like online tests and stuff, it's like 10 times. You can also tell that, like, in a way, we both conscious women so consciously want to show a certain version of ourselves. So, like if the test is like on a scale of, like, strongly disagreed, or strongly agree, how much would you agree, and it's something that societally, you know, people should agree with?\n\nSure, we're more inclined to click agree, even if we don't just because we don't want to show sure or go against that. Yeah, how many of you respond yes to this? Are you a racist? That's me. Might be a little politically Incorrect. So, and I, you know? I, you know, relationship, uh, social desirability is an important thing, right?\n\nI know, I, I might, even, I might not even know that I'm that I might honestly be fooling myself, saying I'm not that right, but I could also be, I know I am, and it would be really uncool to confess that to somebody, right? And I don't want them to know that about me.\n\nSo I respond in a politically correct or socially desirable way. Now, it turns out, it's kind of interesting that certainly limits some people. We have measures to tap into that so we can partial out those aspects in our research. Um, but people I find are more than happy. To confess stuff, so I think it's a less of an issue then.\n\nThis is just my own personal experience, but I've asked, you know, over the years, some sensitive stuff, and I'm amazed that people say that's ooh. Uh, and they're quite happy about it in those situations. So, you know, I don't know if there's anything to do that or not, or how serious of a problem is, but we can measure it and tap into it.\n\nThe thing is, and yeah, there's been changes. Over the years. To all these things, there's different reasons for it when we are being critical of research. I don't want you just to come and say. You know, well, I was a female sample. Oh, was college students or oh, it was M Turkers and and say that it's all crap because of those reasons.\n\nYou need to appreciate how do those things challenge the theory or the conclusions or the research. And if there's no good reason for that, you need to sort of, you know, uh? But you do need to appreciate and know what the challenges are to those situations. Um, what else?\n\nI know there's more.\n\nSorry guys!\n\nUm. Okay, there's been changes in analysis. In the early days, we spent a lot of time talking about univariate analysis. They're doing univering analysis. What is it meant by that?\n\nOne variable. It's not really one variable. You need a minimum of like two right to look at, but it means a small number of of variables, okay to, then a lot of our analyzes. We're simply looking at the relationship between this thing and this thing here. And then we progressed into a multivariate.\n\nUh, set of analyzes, which is pretty dominant. Now, I presume we don't have to spend too much time talking about it. It basically means multiple variables, right, multiple predictor variables, and potentially multiple outcome variables that we might be looking at. What u? Which one's better? In any situation. Psychology.\n\nOkay, you say, a better understanding of the world is to take a multiple multivariate approach that more variables gives me more power in terms of prediction, I think you should be aware of your variables because those can come down into your original um or the original assumptions, so you should be aware of everything to make sure you should be aware of your compound variables so you know what?\n\nWhat's impacting the original variable? Otherwise, you're just going to get lost at all. Okay, okay, um? Is very strong in, like one-on-one predictions, as long as like as she said, you're controlling career confounding or, like, you're paying attention that there might be another Factor that's affecting them, but also multivariate gives you the opportunity to explore the multiple different variables that might be affecting something, and it also allows you to explore interaction effects between them.\n\nSure, maybe if there's something in variables one and two that will affect the outcome of variable. Agree. But if you drop one or two and you won't get the same effect in three, how many variables make up a person? Yes. A lot, right? Who knows? Think about the key variables.\n\nAll the intrapersonal interpersonal environmental forces acting on us? And so, what should we seize upon in terms of understanding? Why, how people do the things they do? Um, you know, isn't multivariant? How many? How many bits of information can a human being remember? Process at any time. Anybody taking the cognitive site?\n\nHow many bits of information can a human being do? At any given time. Yeah, eight, eight too many. I think it's like seven plus nine sure five or six plus or minus, probably changing a little bit. Not many, so even though there's a bazillion variables out there that could capture you.\n\nHuman beings have limited capacity right, and probably that limited capacity means that, uh, they're not going to have full information. We talked about inferences last week. We're making conclusions from limited data. We're doing that all the time. As human beings, the if I could measure everything about you, I could have 100 prediction, right?\n\nUh, but I can't, so our theories probably reflect better the kinds of variables that human beings deal with and human beings probably deal with the big dogs, right? Like, there's these bazillion variables, but there's probably. Three or four or five that actually really matter and count for a significant amount of this outcome that we're interested in.\n\nAnd if that's the case, then we might think a multivariate world is a more. It gives us more knowledge, better understanding all of these things. It might, not because human beings aren't attending to all of those variables that we think are important. What we need to do is focus on the variables and the numbers that human beings are using in their world to negotiate their world to make social decisions and act and include those in our theories and our analyzes.\n\nAnd my guess, is that a more some kind of moderate, uh, more univariate. A little bit of multivariate, but uh, the guy who trained me, he said. Yeah, this is all based on theories. Theories identify the number of variables, their relationships. I'm going to talk more about that, but he said.\n\nTheories are like dogs, the big ones. They don't lash that long, you know, those great things that look like little horses. They only last about 7 years, right? That's all they lift the little dogs. They go on forever kind of thing, and theories are very much the same way.\n\nWhy is that? I don't know. My guess is that when you have a big Grand Theory with lots of different variables. It's not what people use, it's too much information. It's too hard to test them. They don't reflect and represent the actual State of Affairs, and so that's why they don't last long.\n\nThey don't have a lifespan. We're the little ones that do capture the essence of what people are using, and so those things matter. So that is sort of captured, you have to be careful in terms of our model. The other thing that we're really focused on more than anything lady is this notion of mediation.\n\nIt comes back to this thing here is related to that. Why is mediation mediators are the theoretical explanations for? Two things happen. What do I mean by that? You might find there's a relationship between gender and aggression. Turns out that boys are more aggressive than girls. That's interesting, important to know why.\n\nWhy is it? Why does that happen? What kind of what counts for that? Um, maybe it's because they are physically stronger. That's why, sure, they've got muscles. They use them. Have you ever heard of something called testosterone? Um, that actually is highly linked to aggression. What about socialization? Guilty.\n\nI have a son. I have two daughters. I treat them differently. I have different expectations about them. We all do, right? So, I don't know what the answer to that question is, I'm sort of. We can move along, but, uh. But basically that's why, and that's what is important, right?\n\nOtherwise, we're just describing we're saying indeed, boys are more aggressive than girls, but we really want to know why there's often multi-factors, multimediation, or multi-mechanisms that can account for things. It's rare that you find the explanation it's using multi-mechanistics. So, yeah, that's where a lot of the analyzes are sort of focusing on now and capturing bigger.\n\nYou know, complete models with sort of a ringed number of variables, okay? So, essentially, those are the kinds of things, um, that social psychologists. Um, have been looking at and changes in those kinds of things, and I don't want to lead you to believe that. That's all there is.\n\nThere's certainly other things we've learned a lot through this research, but there's still things that we're looking at, um. More recently. We've been looking at. Oh, changes in recent appointments, too. Mention that question that's questionable research about it, so people studying, like, how was the study done under, you know, didn't use the scientific method?\n\nDidn't do it well?\n\nOkay, uh. So what are we doing? I'm just going to put this card here. While this technology is not working right, so what? What are people looking at again? These are just some examples, so social cognition still tends to be something that we're continue to spend a lot of time on trying to understand how individuals make sense of themselves and other individuals.\n\nSocial neurosciences a big part of that, too, and this is studying how the brain structures and functions, um, affect things like cognition of motion and behaviors. And then also getting into other issues around research methods, both statistical methods and research methods, which are different from each other. Um, they're part of our methods, but they deal with different aspects.\n\nSo our TV? Uh, associated with something called P hacking. Some of you will know that. One of the criteria we believe in Psychology. There are many sort of the worth of value of findings input and have a p-value of less than 0. There's things you can do. Questionable things you can do to lower your p-value to make it more palatable to other scientific to help keep acting.\n\nAnd there's a lot of people doing work on that. There's also something called not with hypothesis statistical testing, um. Uh, and that's basically associated between hacking, but it is, uh, something that people question. Um, and, uh, people doing research on that and the issue there is. It gives us something, but a lot of people think it gives us something else.\n\nIt's saying something else, then, well. Um, we wanted to say so. There's issues associated with that.\n\nOkay, so. Hi, in social psychology has an extensive history. Um, but in terms of recorded history, it's only been scientifically studied for essentially. A century Our Century, and we've learned a lot. And, but there's still a lot more to know. In terms of? How we think about influence and relate to one another based on the actual imagine and implied presence of other people, and that process of finding that out is referred to as research.\n\nWhat is that? So, what is research?\n\nOkay, she says, the process of asking and gathering information like to add on to it, like you're doing it systematically. So, it's not random, so you're using a specific systematic procedure to do said questioning and asking okay, fine. So research is only research if I go. If I ask a question and I do that in a systematic way, if I just simply go and read a newspaper, you know, remember those things that I know some different?\n\nNow, I think we probably still call it. Newspaper, I'm not sure, um, but if I go and read, you know, a news site or something like that or a newspaper? Am I engaging in research? You say, yes, you say, no? Uh, because it's not systematic, or if I'm trying to gather information, well, it depends.\n\nLike, if I guess it goes back to like what your, what's your hypothesis? Like, what are you trying to figure out if it's in relation to what is written in news articles and you read one. That's not really necessarily going to give you any grounds in order to do research.\n\nYou need to be like, you need to have something consistently like you can't be reading one news article. Then you go to one, you know, you ask a friend, and then, because all those things are going to vary. So, you're not really going to have a standard Baseline to follow in order to get proper research.\n\nYeah, what you're saying, but it might also provide some breadth of information. Wow, I'm reading it in the New York Times and reading it in the globe. My friends are talking about it. My mom and dad are talking about it. You know, kind of thing, and is that valuable in finding out information feeling like you've got your finger on the pulse?\n\nIn those situation, or is it only systematic by saying, I want to find out what is being reported in the newspaper and go and get every single newspaper that you can in your general area and assess. How they're writing about these issues. Well, I guess that's the difference between quantitative and qualitative research inside.\n\nIf you're doing a quality that we want, like very specific details. Whether you can also do a mixed research methods approach, where we combine both of these methods, so we get multiple newspapers we look at, and then we also do interviews of people in the situation. And then we've created a whole series, but is research only a formal?\n\nSystematic. I know you talked about hypotheses, too. Does it have to be hypothesis driven? What if it's just like, I wonder? I wonder what they're saying about this? I wonder without having an expectation or a prediction about that, like surveys. I guess, but surveys can, too. I can still collect data on something survey people on variables and everything, and look at associations.\n\nI can just look at those to see what, but I could also have some expectations of that, too. But my point is. Does it have to be one of those things or the other, or does that matter, or is research a broader thing or a very? Specific systematic thing, so I think when you're doing research in the interest of learning, then you would probably be looking at, like, police.\n\nI don't reinvent the wheel you'd be looking at, like peer reviewed articles you'd be looking at, like a bunch of different, uh sources, and you'd be looking at stuff in order to gain information on the topic. But if you're producing research and you were like trying to experimentations not super great in Pike, but like if you're doing like correlational research, or you're trying to find stuff like that, then that's more of the system matter approach that I think she was talking about which case you do need a hype up.\n\nYou do need like different explanations, and you need like different wages. Look for similarities because? Sure. Okay, good, that's getting really one more. And then, I'm gonna move. I think you should be a very casual thing because you're being like early at school, where you can take a research a project you should be able to.\n\nWe are doing something you know? That's considered research, and there's a performance when travel research. I think the most important things is not just, um, a variety of particles of the source, the following the sources anymore. Yeah, you know, I, I have colleagues. We have a very strong what's called history, Theory, and critical thinking area in our department, and most of those colleagues are historians.\n\nAnd try to imagine what they do. They're not out there running experiments and looking at correlations between variables. But if I told them what you do is not research. You cannot believe what kind of a battle I would get into and how insulting that would lead to them. In fact, it's an ongoing issue.\n\nI don't ever think that I totally get get what they do, and I see it as research. But, you know, they're basically reading historical documents. And come into conclusions based on that. There's nothing I don't know if it's systematic or not, I guess from time to time, but it's, um, it's fairly broad and just set out on another thing.\n\nAnother perspective you can look at it is like when you do, like, market research for like a product. For example, thinking about, like, oh, what would someone need in like a specific Niche when you're developing a product, you're you're kind of seeing, like, what do people want? And in that sense, it's like, if you're developing something new.\n\nIt's not like you have something standard to like research, but like, you just kind of learn right about it. And then from there. These groups and a lot of that is qualitative, but quantitative as well. Quite small groups. I mean, one of the things the criticism in the past was when we were doing research.\n\nIt had to be like large, and today I'm going to talk about representative samples how important those kinds of things are, but I one thing about qualitative work that has made me really even more submit with it now than I was before. That is, it's really remarkable. What you can glean about a topic from cert from interviewing 10 or 15 people?\n\nIn fact, after that point, you reached this thing, called saturation, and essentially, you get no new ideas after that. It's remarkable for such a small group of people that you can really put your finger right on the pulse. Uh, it's really great that way. Um, and yeah, the way I see research is.\n\nThis process of asking? And answering a question. Research is simply about asking and answering a question, and we use a set of systematic procedures to help protect us against bias. So, I see research as. Um, this method of asking and answering a question with a set of systematic procedures, which assist researchers in avoiding bias.\n\nSo, I know, you mentioned this earlier, and so this is sort of how I see it. But I just realized now in the process of this, I should have asked you guys something that I early on at the beginning of class that I want to come in a little later, and so once you write that down, if you're doing the writing down part of it.\n\nWithout that, I want to just ask a few questions.\n\nHow many of you think you're going to do better than average? How many of you think just raise your hand? This is not the time for modest people. If you think you're going to do better than average in the class. I need you to raise your hand because I want everybody to look around if you think you're going to do better than average in this class?\n\nRaise your hand. Okay, raise it up if you truly feel that you'll get a sense of. It's not time for modesty. Raise it up and keep it up because I want people to look around. Can you raise your hand up if you think that people just look around how many people don't respond how you think I want you that politically correct way, um?\n\nHow many people have their hands up? Would you say? Is it 50? Honestly, you guys if you feel that raise your hand high so we can see it. Not everybody has their hand height, so I want people to look around. Is it more than half? Raise your hand high if you think you're gonna do better than the average in class.\n\nLook around it's a more than fifty percent. No, it's like 40, it's only 40. Even less. Uh, yeah, I, I say, it's more than that. I'd say it's about 60 percent. What's an average? What's an average? For me to find what that is. Yeah, it's when you take the grand total of the sum and divide it by the number.\n\nSo if over 60 percent of the people think they're going to do better than the average, then you actually do better than the average. You have 60 well, uh, well, I'm going to come back here. Yeah, what's an average? Um, well, that's like the mathematical way to, yeah, tell me how does one?\n\nWhat? What is an average? Okay, go for you. You would like to find the average grade? You would take everyone's grade, add it all up, and then divide it by the total number of people in the class or the tell the number of people who took the exam. Yes, okay, more important, right?\n\nSo you want to add up all the scores and divide it by the number of people who contributed that scores. And it produces this one value, right? It's called a measure of central tenancy. This is often what we're doing when we're assessing people. We're trying to reduce all of you.\n\nI'm so sorry about that, down to one number, right, uh, on average, a benchmark where you can gauge yourself. There's this thing called, um. Called the normal distribution. Have you ever heard of that? The idea is that we're reviewing certain things in life. Uh, particularly, achievement oriented things it, uh, it basically.\n\nIs represented by something called a normal distribution, and what a normal distribution looks like and is. In terms of our grades. So you have, like, eight. Plus, you have F, and you have, let's call it five. Percent 68. Percent in another five percent, and it it represents all of your scores on that first exam are probably going to represent this thing called a bell curve.\n\nNormal distribution. And what this normal distribution essentially says, is that sorry, that's a little bit too high. I was a little bit too ambitious there.\n\nBasically, when you write your first exam, there's going to be a an average and that average, let's call it a c. Does anybody know what the scene is? What the average for a c greatest 65, 60 to 65? Okay, something like that? I know nobody thinks they're right, you know, average, or wants to be average.\n\nBut that's in fact, the qualitative anchor to that is average. That's what that means. And basically, when people follow a normal distribution, essentially, we get this mere image and the vast majority of people are going to end up with this C and the and the majority of them are going to be here.\n\nIn here, 68 percent in a small number of people. Uh, this is not really a good place for that. This would be like if this would be like a plus. This would be C. This is like B something and D something over here. Okay, so forget about the vertical axis.\n\nThis is just on the, and so, if you, if something unfolds in terms of a normal distribution, we get this near image of responses. And the average is using this Middle Point here. The mean median mode, those measures of central tendency, are all going to be the same, but essentially what it says is that, um, you get the same number of people above that mean as below that mean?\n\nSo it would be statistically impossible for more than 50 percent of you to get above average on that exam. Now, I think I've got a very modest class. I think it was more than 50. It wasn't that much more. I called it 60, but there's times I've had 80 percent of people put up their hands and say, yeah, I'm gonna do better than average.\n\nHow could that be? How could it be that 80 of people think they're going to do above average when that's not how it shakes out or it's going to shake out?\n\nI think, because like in our heads, when we're initially asked that question, we think average based off of what we think is average, and everyone has like a different idea. So, like in my head, when I initially thought average, I thought like? A bee, so, and then someone else might think an average is a c.\n\nSo right, it could be a b, but I just mean in terms of the. How many of you think you're going to do better than average in this class that there's going to be an average score could be a c. It could be a, b, and listen if everybody here gets 90 and above.\n\nI'll give you an A plus. We'll get fired, but I'll do it. I'll give everybody a new class of this course, and in this exam. If you do that, but it's not going to shake out that way. I'll tell you what it's going to shake out like that. Um, I don't know what the mean is going to be tend to have, like a, b, average, and then it's a little loaded more towards that, but essentially it's going to be around.\n\nThe reason we think we're going to do better has to do with that bias, where we just pause. Why would we think that, I mean, do you get up, you know, most days, and say, today's going to be where I'm my less than self. Kind of saying, no, right, I mean, who, how would you, can you imagine coming and saying, I'm gonna fail.\n\nThat exam gives you horrible. I'm going to do less than average. We don't do that, right, that's self-serving. Bias and also people are optimistic because it's the start of the year. Yeah, there's. It's the start of the year, but you've got a year under your belt, likely in terms of knowing how this thing all shakes out.\n\nBut maybe that changes? It could also be like, because you know, majority of people only have you know, a year, under their belt, they spent most of last year, and first year classes where the dropout rate is incredibly High, sure. So they might have information, but it is kind of interesting that we find.\n\nAs I find this over and over again when I ask and what could explain that when it's a statistical impossibility, and yet the vast majority of people think they're going to do better than average. And I think there's probably some functional value in that, right? I don't know if you've ever been down about anything right or thought that it's, you know, that you perform poorly.\n\nIt's not, like, you're totally revved up to go at it again in the future, right where, if you did. Well, now, you can't, right. You can feel like you're backed into a corner, dig down and and go forward. But the there's some value in thinking that you're going to do better than average, and this is what is referred to as self-serving.\n\nBias. We'll go another 10 minutes or so, and then we'll take a break. Okay, uh, this is the self-serving bias, which is this tendency we have to view ourselves favorably. You can imagine the functional value. Have you ever hung out with somebody who's a little dampened down? It's up sometimes, right?\n\nUm. By people who are happy? Who said it tells in a positive light, they tend to be a little bit more engaging. So, just in terms of social function, there's real value in that, seeing yourself doing better than average. Yeah, I have a question. Is this the same thing as when we are in a negative situation, we think that negative result is not going to happen to us.\n\nIs that the same thing, uh, possibly? I don't know much about that, but, uh. It's possible that that's right, you know, that if you're speeding, you're going to get a ticket, but you're like? Yeah, you risk it. That's another, yeah, probably something else worked into there, too. Um, where you think I have really good luck, and uh, yeah.\n\nDoesn't itself serve in buyers also like, carry some weight to your self-protection. So, like people who raise their hands like, aren't we now more likely to, you know, want to uphold what we think about ourselves, so I might study harder in an attempt to actually score up a beverage because I think that I should, or I can't, sure, yeah, there's.\n\nSo, there's lots of different explanations for why that is, but why we do these things, but essentially the idea is that it's self-serving in some way to make yourself have a better view of yourself. One of the first things we're going to talk about. Next class, I believe, is the self-concept.\n\nAnd this is kind of related that. How about this? Do you know that there's a strong positive correlation in Toronto? Between the number of religious institutions and our murder rate. Did you know that strong, positive correlation between the number of religious institutions and the murder rates? What do I mean by that?\n\nBecause you answer what I mean by that. Yeah, okay, what do? I mean, you're saying that as more religious, um, like institutions go up, big primary goes up. Yeah, murder rate goes up, right? So, it's true, right? Religion does cause violence in America. Right? And just some new faces here.\n\nSorry, I don't want to quash the regular responders like that. I mean, I don't think that's necessarily true because of the whole thing of the correlation versus causation, right? You can't just look at one being correlated on obvious movement therapist. Okay, so you're not disputing that that correlation exists.\n\nYou're just saying that's not a good interpretation of it. Yeah, okay, what? How should I interpret that? So, why is that? Why is it that the more religious institutions in Toronto, the higher the murder rate? What relationships have this thing where they intend to set up new ones around other areas and the more populated an area is, the more statistically possible there will be more crime.\n\nOh, that's an awesome insight about that. So it's not that religion causes this kind of violence. It's that that there's violence and religion goes to it. Right and helps? In those situations, so that's another possible interpretation of that, because with correlation, you don't know whether this thing's going there or this thing's going there.\n\nIn those situations, so that's a possibility. Any other insights, uh? Something similar to that is poverty, so it's more common for people in poverty to be religious and of, like, have that as a part of their life and and all causes. Yeah, yeah, I know, you're saying, yeah, so right.\n\nAnd so, what you're identifying here is that there could be a third variable problem. What happens what a third variable is, a variable that can explain another relationship that doesn't quite make sense. What could that variable be poverty? Maybe what else? What's what's Toronto got? Population people. It's not only Toronto that has that any large Urban center has this correlation between religious institutions and the murder rate, because the more population you have, the more religious institutions you have, the higher the murder rate is.\n\nSo there's this third variable that can explain that. How about this? Do you know that there's a negative relationship between the number of electronic devices in the home, an unwanted teenage pregnancy? I got a teenage daughter. Should I be buying her iPads blenders? You know, iPhones? Yes, um. In that situation.\n\nYeah, I kid you not that there's a negative correlation between the number of electronic devices in the home and unwanted negatives or unwanted teenage pregnancy. So, the more those things less of that? And that once again goes into the fact of like. Not always, but you know, statistically, you know, we see teenage pregnancy more so and?\n\nPoor communities, and that they therefore can't probably afford a lot of technology. So that's why we might see that correlation, okay, kind of related to that, uh, you, and then you should. Yeah, um, another thing we can add is that they have more access to social media. They can be more knowledgeable, so maybe they know more.\n\nOkay, sure, I just said, until Nisha said, um, I would say. If you have more electronics, that sort of thing they tend to be more expensive. The more money you have, the better education you might have to know about teenage pregnancies. And then, also like if you do get pregnant.\n\nYou probably have the resources, and so, yeah, all of these are potential third variable problems. Uh, more money. You make, probably tied to education. Probably, we know that, you know, more education. You make more money, make more money you can afford to have, um, more electronic devices. But then, what accounts for the relationship to unwanted teenage pregnancy?\n\nMaybe it comes to education and understanding birth control. Maybe it's access to birth control and health, uh, it's being able to afford those things as well, so it's a third variable that explains that as well, simply because, like, you're so focus on the electronics at home. You're not going out making those social connections.\n\nYeah, right. So, who knows what the answer to that is, but it's probably a third variable problem in those situations. Uh, one more in that item. It's just a question about the concept of, like, the correlation is, can there be more than like a third variable? So, say, um.\n\nJust on average, the number of electronics hold because we become more dependent on them is growing. So, therefore, there's more and also not related to that, like amount of like race control being contributed or amount of Education or information, going statistically all of those things. But what that is is an illusory correlation, and that's seeing correlation between things that doesn't really exist.\n\nAnd we do that. We can see that. And it can be used, but there are multiple explanations, probably multiple third variables for whatever variables that can account for that, but it leads to an illusory correlation scene associations where they don't really exist. But I think people are ready for a break.\n\nIs that right? Okay, 15 minutes. I don't know what time he got on your device. Look at it, or he got it.\n\nYou sometimes have this tendency when you're judging other people to particularly something negative happens to see it as a function of band something about them. Right in those situations. Okay now, um? Imagine the next exam after that. You are the one who doesn't do well. And you run into that person after grade, and you're exhibiting some distress.\n\nAnd they say, what's going on, you say? Well, remember, last exam. Well, this exam, I did really poorly. Um, what are your attributions then about that? Well, because even with the last test, I would probably think, like, if I also did poorly and they did poorly, I tried to blame it on the test and say, oh, well, the test was too hard.\n\nIt's not me, right, if that was the case, but you didn't this, is it? But now you've done poorly, and so is that what you might do? You might say that was a killer exam, so blame it on the test or Professor sucks or something like that.\n\nAnd what I'm hearing a lot of is not me. It's the situation kind of right. So when something negative happens to another, we're sort of all in on you. Not the situation. Right? However, when something's negative to me, it's all about the situation. And not about me and my lack of effort.\n\nAnd I study strategy, my getting stuck right, and those situations. Um, and that's referred to as the fundamental activation. Here it gets a little bit more complicated than that, and I'm going to just spend a couple of minutes on that, but the fundamental attribution error is this tendency we have when we're judging others to see disposition as the cause and not the situation to overestimate disposition or the person and to underestimate the situation.\n\nBut there's, it matters whether it's positive or negative. When it's negative two, it's all about you, not the situation. When it's negative mean, it's all about the situation and not meaning. Now, think about the reverse of that. The first time you saw that person, they were totally ecstatic excited after that first exam, and you asked why he said, wow, like 87 exam pretty well.\n\nWhat are we think in that situation? Okay, she said. They were probably lucky. In that situation. Oh yeah, that's a great course. Information's easy, those kind of things. Yeah, I did really good. Yeah, I tried and really good. Yeah, okay, that other, but when you're judging that other person?\n\nThinking that that I did really good, or you're you're, I'm talking about your judgment of that person. I would say that, oh, they're smart, okay. Ignore the hard-working part, okay? If it's like someone else that's doing mobile, you're kind of like, oh, like, it was probably the situation of like the test was really easy for them, this or that, sure.\n\nLike, we don't always think, like, oh, they just right. And then, think about yourself. In that same situation, the next example, after you're not, you dream hardly, but you do really well. Not that you're thinking course socks? Or is it difficult exam you're thinking about? Wow, how amazing am I right?\n\nAnd so, when something negative, and we're judging others. It's all about them, and not the situation when it's something negative, and we judge yourself. It's all about, uh, the situation and not herself. When something positive, we get the complete opposite of that. When it's positive, it's all about the situation.\n\nThat's an easy course. It's easy information. How could you not learn in that course? Lot about the situation anymore. In the course and environmental factors is all about you and your capacity, and I think when it's something negative about ourselves. We try to cope and deflect like, we don't want to take that accountability.\n\nIt's a tangled web, we we in these situations in many respects, but it gets even a little bit more complicated than that, um. That we have this. Hedonic bias, as well as his fundamental attribution error. Uh, but we also have this thing called an actor Observer effect, which I want to work in there as well.\n\nAnd that is again all of this stuff together. Is it matters whether I'm judging you or judging me? That's the actor Observer effect. If I'm observing you and judging you. I have one set of judgments if I'm judging me or observing me. I have another set of. You know, judgments.\n\nIf it's positive or negative information and also the attributions, so these all. Uh, come together, uh, the fundamental education there. The actor Observer bias, which is when we're judging others. Our affects. We're judging Indians or affects, and our judgments are affected by the perspective of the judge, whether I'm an actor or an I'm an observer.\n\nUh, and this hedonic bias that we're trying to maximize goodness and minimize that. And so, all of this to suggest that human beings are biased in the way we protect information, right? We have this fundamental attribution there. This hedonic bias this actor Observer effect we have these illusory correlations.\n\nI could go on for the rest of lecture, listing all of the biases we have. How could, how could that be? Is, there is the truth matter. His. Things matter. How could we, if we're so biased? As human beings. How could we have? How can we build this building?\n\nHow can we develop education? How could we do these things if we're so biased? What could explain that?\n\nAlways biased towards yourself. They would like to build a building to build the very first buildings, and it was like, hey, instead of doing a right angle through this angle, and then your bias on that. So I think maybe the fact of like how the music, social judgments, the greatest become better?\n\nOkay, you're saying they actually. These biases work for us. Yeah, in some way. That's how that's what could explain it. We're so biased, and bias is an inaccurate view of the way the world unfolds. Doesn't that matter? Um. Well, um, I think it's kind of like it was, like, people like to believe, um, bad things happen to bad people.\n\nOkay, sure, I get how that protects. It's all sort of there to protect ourselves in some way. But is there some overall Advantage is an important question, how could we be biased and be so successful? You would think there would be to be some kind of critical analysis some objective.\n\nIn order to be successful, and I guess the only way I can sort of grasp, this is a lot of these biases that human beings have have been selected out over time because they're functional. They work. What do they do more often than not? They minimize the biggest mistakes.\n\nThese things more often than not are in place to minimize those mistakes. And that's why, over time, over time, over time, they kind of work for us now. I'm also not trying to imply because people aren't able to think objectively or relatively clearly. That's where critical thinking I'll come out of to try and develop those skills.\n\nBut that's what could explain them. Okay, so? Um, next thing I want to talk about if human beings are biased in this way. Probably it affects. Not only the types of questions we ask, but how we answer those questions. Right. So when we go back to what research is all about, it's about asking and answering a question with a set of systematic procedures that help protect us against bias.\n\nAnd so, that's what the scientific method is. It's basically human beings are biased, and we need to take that into account so that we can get a more accurate assessment or test of something, and so these biases are part of that process, and the scientific method was developed in order to manage those those situations.\n\nLike, and the scientific method.\n\nYou have to begin with a research question. I think. This thing is related to that thing. Um, you know, one of the things I often try to work with is you've probably heard, uh, that watching violence on television can lead to? Right, and I think that there's a fair bit of evidence that shows that this is really a big issue for kids, right?\n\nSo, if kids watch aggressive television, they're more likely to progressively. But, you can wonder that, is there a relationship between watching life community on television not being aggressively when this talk is starting to be explored. Of course, all the television stations and Hollywood that were promoting violent movies. They're trying to argue, no, no, it's just, you know, you're not going to turn violent just because you're watching it kind of thing.\n\nSuspicious of these mode as well. As it turns out, there's a fair bit of evidence to support this idea now that if we are watching Violent from television. We're going to be more aggressive, but let's say this is our question that we think kids who watch more violence on television are going to be aggressive.\n\nThen we need to choose a fear. What's a theory?\n\nBe left. Therefore, you're more likely to act. Yeah, so some idea about how things unfold or how things happen. That's what your your definition of the theory is. Okay, any other? Okay, right? So a theory can answer why, to some extent, but it might also just capture relationships between variables and not necessarily tell us, right?\n\nIt's possible, um? Me a theory is a reasonable set of variables or constructs. A theory is a reasonable set of variables or constructs. That interrelate and help us to understand. Why and how things and form. So, a theory is a reasonable set of variables and constructs that interrelate and help us to.\n\nAnd help us to predict, control, and understand some phenomenal. There is a reasonable set of variables and constructs that digital relate and help us to understand.\n\nMeasurable. Sure, but I probably can measure.\n\nSo, it is.\n\nSure. Sure, that's the type and I would do it. I want to go back to the answer to that question. How many business information. Can you sending your mind? What's your reasonable said, probably around four or six variables? Again, I've seen theories with 10, 12, 50 years is two complex.\n\nThe number of variables, how they would need to relate. Is a couple is too few made me. Okay, so the readings that I would be reflects. What if he being healed? So that's how I would argue that, so you have to choose the theory, I think, um. Watch violent television are going to become more aggressive, okay, and we're gonna get at why that in a little bit.\n\nUm, and maybe the idea there. The theory is social learning here. I'm going to talk about that at some point, but you watch other people. Do things you see that it works for them. So then you try and imitate it and do it. And voila, it works for me.\n\nSo that could be the explanation for why this happens. Then, we need to make a hypothesis. What's that?\n\nWhat's that? It's an if then statement. Sure, that's still a little inaccessible, right? What is the hypothesis? Yeah, it's a prediction. It's a prediction. Yeah, a prediction about how two variables or more would relate to each other. Did you want to sure, it's an educated guess. Yeah, it's an educated guess, maybe rooted in your theory about how those things?\n\nYep. To focus on improving. Sure, yeah, it's a testable research question, right? I think there's going to be a relationship between watching violence on television and acting aggressively. So, what's your prediction? The more violent television you watch, the more aggressive you're going to be. That's what your prediction is.\n\nIt's a testable question that comes out of that.\n\nChoose a sample. What's a sample?\n\nI okay, so she says a sample is a subgroup. Would you say? Of individuals that represent a population. A population is everybody. Whenever we're doing a study, are we talking about human beings from all over the world? Sometimes lots of times we are. Do we ever sort of toxin those ways, but um?\n\nMight be talking about torontonians or Canadians or. Europeans or something like that. So that's your population, uh, in those situations, but remember going back to resources and research, we are limited in terms of what we can do, and it's it. Like, if the population was even site 2120 students, it would be a lot at York over this Academic Year.\n\nChoose a sound, a subset of 2100 social students, and so, but there's different kinds of samples. But there's basically this subset. And this subset comes from the population, and so, how do we choose that sound? How do we choose that subset of people? Okay, she says she's going to.\n\nUm, do what's called a random sample? What's a random sample? Generally thinking randomly. So, if, like, 10 people come through a room, I'm going to ask every person that comes through that room. But if it's a majority, I might just play every good person I'll ask for every. Okay, well, even that sounds a little systematic, uh, random.\n\nOkay, you want to say, yeah, I was just gonna say, like, you could also do like a stratified sample if you need like, you know, like, if you have like population stuff, there's another one. So that's another kind of sample, but a random sample is when everybody in that population has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nDo that. So here's our population, please. Here's our sample. It's smaller than that.\n\nAnd. Our population looks like this. Right. However, think of that as pieces of a pot. Uh, gender, culture, religion. But if I'm interested in a population, it's usually way too big, so I need to get a subset. But that subset, because that's what I'm interested. If I take a step set of people and they don't look like that when I'm done, my study.\n\nIt can't then go back and say, oh, so this happens for all people in 2020 or whatever. I can't say that if that doesn't look like that. The way to make that look like that is to do random sampling, where everybody in that population has an easier chance of getting selected.\n\nThis is kind of fascinating if you take 1200 people randomly from any calculator. You can 95 confident that it will have the characteristics of that population. Doesn't matter how big of a sample it is, how big of a population it is if you take 1200 people randomly? From that population, you can do 95 confident.\n\nThere, so that whatever you find out. Here you can generalize back to that thing there. Um, that's really quite fascinating. Does anybody know where you read about random samples and getting those kinds of numbers? I don't know how few guys have been reading any empirical articles? It's rare in Psychology that you look at an empirical article with unsend your multiple studies and you find samples that are 1200 or more and randomly selected from the population more often than not.\n\nReusing site 1010 students and turkers. Prolific other community samples. They're nowhere near 1200 people, and so almost everything we're getting is biased, right? We're not doing that.\n\nMeta-analyzes meta-analyzes not necessary, but it can add up to these are systematically, but they might not be chosen randomly in that situation, right? Yeah. Calls for like survey data? Yeah, what kind of surveys are we doing maybe sure that we might get it there? You know where holsters voting?\n\nMoney where their mouth is right, or they don't get hired next time, and they make a lot of money to take the temperature of a group of people to find out what way they're going to vote, who they're going to vote for, and they need to be confident about that, right?\n\nSo that's where you see often when you hear a poll. It's like 1192 people plus or minus something or other, but it's around that 1200 Mark. They've been chosen randomly from our if it's Canadian or Ontario or Toronto or whatever. And that's where you see that, but it's rare that you see a random sample so more often out.\n\nWe have biosentials. There are convenience samples. I might give a questionnaire to you guys to find out something or we use 1010, which is not necessary convenient, but it's more convenient than a random sample, but you rarely see this.\n\nIf I do a lab study and in lab study, usually the classic social psychological study takes about an hour. But I need about an hour and a half to process each partnership, right? If I had to do 1200 people in every single study that I was interested in. I would be one study in my career basically, right?\n\nUm, and so, there's these kinds of limits on this as well, but Anya, you need to choose a sample and the reason you want. This thing here to look like that thing here. The same percentage of men and women, the same percentage of this culture, that culture, this religion that religion, all of the pachadelos, the Nuance that's in any population, should be represented in that.\n\nThere. Once we have that, then we do. A study. And we. One of three dominant research methods we either do not experiments, which is often called correlational. I don't like the term correlational because it's a statistical technique. It's not a research method, but it's often called correlational and single experiment.\n\nSomething called quality experience. Each one of these is unique. It has a unique signature, and it's used to answer a specific kind of question, and also it affects our conclusions. You can't make the same conclusions from each of these studies, and so it depends what your conclusions are that you want to draw from this?\n\nThat can help choose the method some variables might be. You might be able to manipulate and others. You might not be open some because it's impossible to manipulate to others at a unethical and manipulate. So in those cases, you would have to choose something different. I'm going to talk about each of these.\n\nThen you can verify that by knowing and checking what they write about and then you can also see what they conclude and you might think every scientist gets it, right? I can't tell you how many conclusions I've read in the discussion sections that are not fitting with the method that's chosen, right?\n\nUh, and so, you have to challenge. You have to be thinking critically about this stuff. Hang a question mark on everything.\n\nAnd then, once you do the study, you want a generalize that. So, let me go through. A non-experiment, so a non-experimental study? Is a study that involves examining the relation between two or more naturally occurring variables. I think there's an association between watching violence on television and acting aggressively.\n\nAnd let's say we're interested in this in terms of ours preschoolers. Critical, so I think there's going to be an association, so we're looking for two or more variables in a naturally occurring. Seven. So, what would those variables be? What are the two variables? I think there's a relationship between watching violence on television and acting aggressively.\n\nYeah. Sure, it's kind of sometimes. If it's a non-experiment, you don't use the term independent variable. Sometimes we do. It's more like a predictor variable. Um, but, uh, that that's sort of the conceptual label of those. But what are the two variables? Uh, watching violence on television and aggression.\n\nSo those are two variables, right? And we're trying to find an association between those. Okay, so what we need to do is obtain a random sample from the population, so if we think this is going to happen in preschoolers. Maybe we go into our neighborhood and we find out where all these preschools are, and we reach out to preschool.\n\nWe got reach out to the preschools and find out if. Hard to have graduate students and faculty from York University go in and assess the preschoolers in terms of how much violence they watch on television and then a measure of their aggression.\n\nUh, we need to obtain a measure on each of these things that we think are related. Ah, okay, so now, tell me something, um.\n\nOkay, and then we we obtain the measures on these two sets. We do a statistical test of the relationship and then based on what we find there. We draw conclusions. That's the general process of a non-experimental. Uh, and then whenever we find if we have a random sample, then we can generalize back to the population.\n\nBut let's say we think this happens all over the world, and I just go and get a sample. Four-Year-Olds at various day cares in the North York area. I'd have to be careful, right? Are they all? Are they representing the larger populations. You'd have to be careful whether you could generalize back to even other preschoolers in Toronto or what have?\n\nOkay, so um, what's the signature of a non-experiment? Each one of these has a signature we have to have two variables. And these variables have to be observable and measurable. What do I mean by observable? Yep, you need a way to like for aggression or something, or in terms of watching my own television.\n\nYou need to know, like, what camps divide on television? How much are they watching, and that impression is what counts? Integrations I have to have an operational definition, which is a way of. Seeing your conceptual theoretical variable, but in terms of observing them, what do I mean? By that, do I have to see it?\n\nBy observing, is that what I mean by that? Yeah, we have to get some sort of whistle, right? If you're able to measure like blood pressure. Things like that you're able to see the blood pressure at the moment we're able to get them. Yeah, okay, there's that, but I it it in some ways you do have to see it, or you have to feel it, or you have to sense it.\n\nSo, what I'm talking about by observable, you've heard of empirical research? That's essentially what it is empirical. Is that you've sensed it in some way? I feel it. I can see it. I can taste it, whatever. But you can sense it in some way, right? And then it has to be measurable.\n\nBy that, I mean, you have to be able to count it up and have more of it or less of it.\n\nAnd then that's two variables in a natural settings, and you can observe the variable and count it up. Then you have the signature for a non-experiment.\n\nOne of the workhorses. For psychology is something called a verbal measure, a self-reported verbal measure. Sometimes you're measuring Behavior. Sometimes we're measuring just people self-reporting on a questionnaire, what they think fail, and do in certain situations. And we use this thing called a records. Yeah, sometimes you may have heard it called a nicot scale.\n\nIt's not the guy's name that's rents as liquor. With the liquor scale. We have two items that reflect one issue. With a liquid scale, we usually have two items that represent one issue, and these items are weighted equally. One, either one item's not more important than the other item.\n\nThey're weighted people, and one of them reflects a favorable view of that issue. The other one reflects a negative view of that issue. Okay, this is the liquor Escape. And let me show you, and now we measure the degree of it. So, let's say we're interested in birth control?\n\nWhether it's a a valuable thing, a healthy thing or not, a healthy thing? Okay, so the first item we come up with is birth. Control should be absolutely prohibited. Is that an item reflecting the favorable side or the unfavorable side? Okay, unfavorable side, right? In terms of General, right?\n\nBut in terms of your view, yeah, right? If you don't believe in it, you might think this is the favorable view of that. I get the point you're trying to make, but basically this is sort of like the negative, unfavorable idea. Versus. Birth control is a legitimate Health major.\n\nNow, if you think that birth control is a great idea? What? How would you respond on those two items? You would say strongly disagree to the first one or somewhat disagree, and then the reverse for the second question. Okay, so you're saying if you believe in this birth control, you're saying people are probably going to respond one or two in the first item four or five on the next item, right?\n\nThat would reflect that if you disagree with it. You get like a reverse pattern from that right, you get four or five on the first one, one, two, and so in some ways, it's like a reliability check or a lie detector, almost on that. What happens if they say Circle three and three?\n\nAcquisition girl, but they're just kind of just always sitting in the middle as well. Oh yeah, uh, possibly, it could be. Did you see their understands, and they don't have it. Sure, I mean, maybe I've never thought about this. Good question, is it a good thing or not. A good thing, you know, I'm never even thought about it before, so it could be that it could be something I've thought deeply about, but I'm not clear.\n\nSides of the story here. Right, and so that could reflect that kind of a situation. Um, how about if I score one on the first and one on the second? Maybe because, well, the first statement is pretty like stream, so perhaps they don't think it should be prohibited and they, but they don't.\n\nThey necessarily believe it's a legitimate Health? Okay, so you're sort of picking up on the 3-3 thing and saying, they're a little confused. It's not really clear it could be that I suck at writing items. Social scientist, and I don't get it right. And it's confusing, like, that's a possibility.\n\nIt could be that the person is not clear themselves on that. It could also be five, five, or four. Four, three, three is difficult because it's like a neutral right in those situations, but when it's five, five or four, four or one one and two two, then we can start thinking that it could be lots of different things.\n\nThey're not really clear. You haven't done a good job of reflecting the issues in your item. What else? Yeah. Great!\n\nTurns out when you're doing research. There's some people participants that want to be good participants. And some, not so much. There's some that say, what does this guy want? I want to help him desperately to confirm his hypotheses, and so they'll try and do their best. There's others they go.\n\nI know exactly what this guy a wants, and I am gonna give him the complete opposite of that. In fact, I'm going to just respond randomly. Two, three, five, you know, whatever, just all over the map. You can't make sense of anything in there. In fact, in the old days, most of these questionnaires now are on electronic format, right?\n\nBut in the old days, it was paper and pencil, and you would have a piece of paper with all of these items on the left side of the page, and all of these scales on the right side of the page, and they some people would go two, two, two, two all the way down.\n\nIn fact, some people were so lazy they were just right in the lips around all of the two. They were giving individually circle them.\n\nIssue is where they confuse, where they just the acting in some way, and so you need to just pick that up, put it in the garbage can and file it because you can't figure out what it is. In terms of the quality of that data, so you, but anyhow, the great thing about this is, it gives us a reliability to check.\n\nThis is really the Workhorse of a lot of social psychology survey research and using verbal measures very valuable. How we collect the data? Uh, let's go say we go into a daycare. How do we get a four-year-old and say to them? How much you buying television? Do you watch you know?\n\nHow do we do that? Yeah, well, you may not necessarily ask the kid. You may ask their parent because they're probably the one who's monitoring. I guarantee you, you'll be asking your parent because there's this thing called the law. Oh, you don't want to be in violation of that, or you complete your PhD from a cell somewhere, um.\n\nGet parents irate about those kinds of situations. Are you asking my kid about because a kid doesn't know probably right, but the parent will possibly be able to report how many episodes of Power Rangers does my kid watch, and there's lots of different ways of operation. I think it could be how much they watch 30 minutes a day or how many episodes they've watched.\n\nYou have to be careful how you operationalize them now. As a parent, I often.\n\nNot sure how accurate I've been in reporting like to my friends. So, did your kid do this or do that? How much, how much television do they get to watch? Oh, no television at all. They don't have advices. They don't spend any time online kind of thing, uh, parenting is just great in our house.\n\nUm, you might not want to fess up, right? So, they might not want to tell you how much they want, so you, there's ways of tapping into this. I think I mentioned with your previous question about social desirability or political correctness, but you might have to measure these other things when you're dealing with politically correct sensitive situations to tap into that and be able to partial those things out.\n\nYou wouldn't necessarily ask the parent to report on aggression. Uh, but you could and again sensitive there too, but you might have your graduate students stand around out in the. Park or wherever at the school and watch kids in the school ground and see how they complete. And you would have operationalizations of aggression.\n\nHow many names a kid gets called? How many times the kid gets pushed down excluded from social situations, these have all be valid forms of aggression. Now, you have to be careful, right? Because it turns out when kids are small, and they like somebody they might push them down.\n\nIt's just their way of telling a man. I like, you, you know, and, and they push him down, so you have to be careful that they interpret it in the way that you're interpreting it there, too. So it's a little bit more complex than all of these things, but you have to figure out what the operational definition is, if it's valid, it represents that, and it's reliable.\n\nIt does that consistently in those situations, so you would do that, and then you would test for different kinds of relationships. Now, tell me something. Let's just think I'm on the x-axis. That's sorry. The y-axis, the vertical x.\n\nThey represent washing violence on television. Okay, so we have two axes, the X, the vert of the horizontal one that's watching violence on television. This, when here, is aggression. Can someone tell me what that? Okay, so this line here represents the pattern of response. You would never get a whole bunch of data points from 100 kids on a straight line like that.\n\nIt's called the line of best fit, and there's in fact, if you were to look at that in terms of responses, it would be a scatter of dots. Um, but often those dots sort of congregate around a line, and this is called the line of effort, so it represents.\n\nPattern, how tightly packed it is. All sorts of different things, but you're saying that represents. A finding, where the more violent television you watch.\n\nThe. Aggression. That makes sense. The more violent television I watch. I looked about mine and I go there. Last aggression. Would have that been your prediction.\n\nA positive correlation, more violent television. More regression. People banding around Freud's name earlier on when we were talking about the history. Uh, anybody know one of the things he's famous for?\n\nUh, in from this point, um, this thing called catharsis. Which is release of something through some other means. He would argue that if you go watch violent television, you don't need to go push that kid down in the schoolyard. You exercise that there, and you can have the release and the experience by watching it in that situation, so that would support if that was your theory that the response is going to be cathartic.\n\nBy watching this stuff. I'm going to have less of it rather than more of it, so that could represent that. So you might have had a prediction and expectation. You look at that and go man. I'm wrong again, kind of, uh, and so you're. Theorizing wasn't very clear on that.\n\nYou can find that, um.\n\nHow about this one? So, this represents a negative correlation, right. A negative correlation says, the more of one thing the less of another correlations can range. A perfect negative correlation is minus one and a perfect positive correlation is, plus one okay, and it can take on any value in between there.\n\nYour correlational work, thinking, if it's a negative correlation, it means a bad thing. If it's a positive correlation, it's a good thing that would be incorrect. You want to look at the strength and Direction. What's more important is how strong of a negative relationship is it how strong of a positive relationship is?\n\nThis one represents a positive relationship. Okay, more of one more of the other.\n\nWhat is the last one time? There's no predictability between it's your variable. Okay, he's saying, regardless of a change in. Watching violence on television. There's no change on aggression. No association right now. I could have drawn that vertically as well and said, regardless of how much aggression there is, there's no violent television being watched or no change in that at all.\n\nUm, so that could represent a no relationship. And again, you never see these perfect kinds of relationships. These are just there to represent the direction and strength of these kinds of relationship. Okay, but you don't, uh. So, what can you conclude from this? What? What can a non-experimental study tell us?\n\nOkay, so it can tell us whether there is a relationship or not, and it can tell us this the strength of the relationship, the valence of it, whether it's positive or negative. Well, I was going to say like the direction of it, the direction of it, yeah, um. What else can it tell us?\n\nYep, if variables are non-causal. Okay, yeah, it can tell us. So, what's the, what's one of the criticisms you heard of correlation and non-experimental research. Okay control for everything, so you tell me it's impact. These things are related, and maybe they predict each other, but you can't prove it, right?\n\nYou're you're off. One of the criticisms is that if you want to make a causal conclusion, you can't do that and and what I was taught when I was coming up was, um, basically non-experimental research or correlation or research says nothing about cause Asia, and I take issue with that.\n\nIt says a lot about causation. It doesn't say nothing about causation. It tells us something, but it doesn't definitively tell us about causation. So, in terms of strengths and we in this, it tells us whether two variables are related. That's important. That's what we want to know, right? Is there any association between these?\n\nYou run a daycare. And the parents are permissive and allow a lot of violent television to be watching. You know that violence violent television leads to aggression? Are you going to admit that kin to your daycare again? Remember, lawyers liability all of these kinds of interviews. If some kid hurts another kid, and so, um, it helps us to.\n\nPredict some phenomenon from it. Now, one thing that I think is great is it can tell us. Uh, it can't necessarily say that this thing here definitively causes this thing here. But if you find no relationship that vertical or horizontal line. It can tell you these things are not commonly related if you find a zero correlation.\n\nIt tells you these things are not common, so it tells you something about causation. It's really important.\n\nNow, what are the reasons for these non-causal relationships Direction? We don't know whether a kid's aggressive or the parents are maybe aggressive, and they allow them to watch more of this television. We also don't know if kids you know are just watching it, and it causes mortgage. So there's this direction issue in terms of.\n\nAlso, we talked about this. There are variable costs. Imagine that there's a beauty priority to know, right? Physical abuse, verbal abuse, whatever a home that has that might be more likely to be accepting of watching violence on television and aggression, so you would see those kinds of things. Situation sometimes.\n\nOkay, uh? So, in order to be able to argue that one variable causes another. We need to be able to run an experiment okay, and so I just really quickly want to. Play the foundation.\n\nMight just screwed this up again. Okay, and yeah, I'll I can do this without, um. 10 minutes, okay? An experiment. Now, what's an experiment? What's the most basic experiment? Essentially, I want to be able to say this thing here causes this thing here. How can I demonstrate that in an experiment just describe to me the most basic experiment?\n\nOkay, it's a manipulation of invariable, just like, uh, a non-experiment had a signature. You had to be able to observe it and measure it. The experiment also has a signature heart of it is manipulation, but there's other aspects control group. Yeah, but that's not necessarily the feature of it.\n\nIt is, it is important. I don't know why it's not considered a signature, but it's because it's not. There's not always a control group. No, and it's not a controlled group where, like, the theoretically defined control. Yeah, their comparisons, they can. Yeah, they're controlling your independence and then measuring your dependent.\n\nAnd then, I'm guessing all their part is that your samples are accurate, okay, um, okay, so?\n\nChanging that? Most basic form. An experiment has two groups. One of those groups is the treatment group that group gets. Whatever it is, you're interested in watching violence on television, watching Power Rangers, or doing something like that. Um, so they get that. The control group is your comparison group, and they get everything that the con that the treatment group gets, except the treatment.\n\nIf they're watching if it's kids and they're watching violence on television, you're controlled, who has to watch something on television that doesn't have violence. What would be a thing of beauty is if you could get the people who produce Power Rangers to do two of the same episodes, but one has violence, and the other one doesn't have violence again.\n\nImmediate resources, those kinds of experiments. So, if you do that experiment, uh, and you manipulate watching violence on television and watching Barney or something like that, and we find out that those kids who watch violent television for sure act more aggressively than those who don't.\n\nWatching violence on television, because that's the only thing that varies. Right, that's the logic of an experiment. The experiment has a controlled group and a treatment group, and they are absolutely identical to each other, except for that one thing, the treatment, and so if there's a change on aggression, it has to be because of that thing, because it's the only thing that varies.\n\nIsolating, reducing one of the criticisms we'll get into. This is that experiments don't reflect the real world, and I say thank you when you come to that, that's exactly shouldn't reflect it real. Well, the real world is noisy, messy. All of those things, and I'm trying to reduce something down to its basic element to show you that that thing there causes that.\n\nThe only way to do that is to strip it down. Didn't reflect in real world. Once you find that out, then you can add layers of life onto it, and I'll spend some time talking about that. I know that was an intent, like your day. Sorry for that. So that?\n\nYou also like are accounting for parenting styles at home. Situations are like that many can measure within one person. Yeah, trying to do it, but you can, but there's issues associated with repeated measures designed too, and learning and all sorts of things that don't necessarily threaten a causal conclusion.\n\nIt's, it's another element in there, but it's challenging, too. There are shortfalls of that, too. Um, and those are called quasi experience, and I'll talk about those next. I still haven't finished this off. I want to talk to you more about this, but I think, is that right?\n\nWell, somebody asked about the bonus points, uh, bonus points I control here. Don't go do a steady like, um, or something like that they are run out of here. I will imagine that I will tell you when they're available and don't be looking tired. Okay.\n\nHello, I wasn't it.",
