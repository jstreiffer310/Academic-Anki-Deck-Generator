## What happens during REM sleep?

Rapid eye movements, vivid dreams, and memory consolidation occur while muscles are paralyzed.

[#medium-priority]() [#sleep]() [#memory]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How do neurotransmitters communicate between neurons?

Chemical messengers cross synapses to bind with receptors on postsynaptic neurons.

[#medium-priority]() [#neurotransmitters]() [#synapses]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What is the role of the hippocampus in memory?

Converts short-term memories into long-term declarative memories and supports spatial navigation.

[#high-priority]() [#hippocampus]() [#memory]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the autonomic nervous system function?

Controls involuntary bodily functions through sympathetic (fight/flight) and parasympathetic (rest/digest) divisions.

[#medium-priority]() [#autonomic]() [#nervous-system]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What characterizes Alzheimer's disease?

Progressive memory loss due to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles destroying brain tissue.

[#high-priority]() [#clinical]() [#alzheimer]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the visual cortex process information?

Primary visual cortex detects basic features (lines, edges) while higher areas recognize objects and faces.

[#medium-priority]() [#visual-cortex]() [#perception]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What is the function of the amygdala?

Processes emotions, especially fear responses, and forms emotional memories.

[#high-priority]() [#amygdala]() [#emotion]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How do action potentials propagate?

Electrical impulses travel down axons through depolarization and repolarization cycles.

[#medium-priority]() [#action-potential]() [#neurons]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What distinguishes white matter from gray matter?

White matter contains myelinated axons for communication; gray matter contains cell bodies for processing.

[#medium-priority]() [#brain-structure]() [#anatomy]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the corpus callosum function?

Connects left and right brain hemispheres, allowing interhemispheric communication.

[#medium-priority]() [#corpus-callosum]() [#brain-communication]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What is the blood-brain barrier?

Selective barrier that protects the brain by filtering substances from blood circulation.

[#low-priority]() [#blood-brain-barrier]() [#protection]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does neuroplasticity work?

Brain's ability to reorganize and form new neural connections throughout life in response to experience.

[#high-priority]() [#neuroplasticity]() [#learning]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What triggers neurotransmitter release?

Calcium influx at axon terminals when action potentials reach synaptic endings.

[#medium-priority]() [#neurotransmitter-release]() [#calcium]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the reticular formation function?

Controls arousal, sleep-wake cycles, and filters sensory information for attention.

[#medium-priority]() [#reticular-formation]() [#arousal]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What is the role of glial cells?

Support neurons by providing nutrients, maintaining homeostasis, and forming myelin sheaths.

[#low-priority]() [#glial-cells]() [#support]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does long-term potentiation work?

Strengthening of synaptic connections through repeated stimulation, forming basis of learning and memory.

[#high-priority]() [#LTP]() [#synaptic-plasticity]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What characterizes hemispheric specialization?

Left hemisphere typically handles language and logic; right hemisphere processes spatial and creative tasks.

[#medium-priority]() [#hemispheric-specialization]() [#lateralization]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How do inhibitory neurotransmitters work?

Make postsynaptic neurons less likely to fire by hyperpolarizing the membrane (e.g., GABA).

[#medium-priority]() [#inhibitory]() [#GABA]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What is the function of the brainstem?

Controls vital functions like breathing, heart rate, and consciousness through medulla, pons, and midbrain.

[#high-priority]() [#brainstem]() [#vital-functions]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the limbic system regulate emotion?

Network including amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex processes emotions and motivations.

[#high-priority]() [#limbic-system]() [#emotion-regulation]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What happens during synaptic transmission?

Neurotransmitters released from presynaptic terminal cross synaptic cleft to bind postsynaptic receptors.

[#medium-priority]() [#synaptic-transmission]() [#communication]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does myelination affect neural conduction?

Myelin sheaths increase conduction speed through saltatory conduction at nodes of Ranvier.

[#medium-priority]() [#myelination]() [#conduction-speed]() [#PSYC2240]()

## What distinguishes motor and sensory neurons?

Motor neurons carry signals from CNS to muscles; sensory neurons carry information from receptors to CNS.

[#low-priority]() [#motor-sensory]() [#neuron-types]() [#PSYC2240]()

## How does the hypothalamus regulate homeostasis?

Controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, and hormone release through pituitary gland connections.
