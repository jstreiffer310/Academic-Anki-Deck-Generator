# FSRS4Anki Setup Guide - October 8th Exam (20 Days)

## üéØ Deck-Specific FSRS Settings for Your 4 Subdecks

Your consolidated deck contains **4 separate subdecks** with different priorities. Here are the optimal FSRS settings for each:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: FSRS Review Limit Requirements

**If you get errors about review limits being too low:**

FSRS schedules more frequent reviews than traditional Anki, so you need **higher review limits**.

**Rule of thumb: Set reviews to 3-4x your new cards per day**

### üî¥ High Priority Deck (581 cards)
**Core concepts, clinical cases - Must know for exam**
```
Desired retention: 0.88 (88%)
New cards/day: 25-30
Maximum reviews/day: 120-150  ‚Üê Higher than traditional Anki
Learning steps: 1m 10m 
Graduating interval: 2 days
Easy interval: 3 days
Interval modifier: 95%
```

### üü° Medium Priority Deck (4 cards)
**Supporting knowledge - Small deck, high retention**
```
Desired retention: 0.90 (90%)
New cards/day: 2-4 (finish quickly)
Maximum reviews/day: 20
Learning steps: 1m 10m
Graduating interval: 3 days
Easy interval: 4 days
Interval modifier: 100%
```

### ‚ö´ Low Priority Deck (194 cards)
**Background knowledge - Efficient coverage**
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Use Your Current 4-Deck Structure (Recommended)
Since your deck generates as 4 separate Anki decks, apply these settings individually:

1. **Import your .apkg file** - it creates 4 separate decks
2. **For each deck**, go to **Options** and create preset:

**High Priority Deck Options:**
```
Preset name: "PSYC2240 High Priority"
FSRS enabled: Yes
Desired retention: 0.88
New cards/day: 25
Maximum reviews/day: 100
```

**Medium Priority Deck Options:**
```  
Preset name: "PSYC2240 Medium Priority"
FSRS enabled: Yes
Desired retention: 0.90
New cards/day: 4
Maximum reviews/day: 20
```

**Low Priority Deck Options:**
```
Preset name: "PSYC2240 Low Priority"  
FSRS enabled: Yes
Desired retention: 0.82
New cards/day: 15
Maximum reviews/day: 50
```

**Cloze Context Deck Options:**
```
Preset name: "PSYC2240 Cloze Context"
FSRS enabled: Yes  
Desired retention: 0.85
New cards/day: 5
Maximum reviews/day: 25
```

### Option 2: If Decks Are Combined (Alternative)
If your import creates one unified deck with tags:

1. **Create filtered decks** by priority tags
2. **Apply different options** to each filtered deck
3. **Study in priority order** (High ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Low ‚Üí Cloze)

## üß† Why These Specific Settings?

### Retention Targets Explained:
- **88% (High Priority)**: Aggressive retention for core concepts
- **90% (Medium Priority)**: Only 4 cards, can afford high retention  
- **82% (Low Priority)**: Efficient coverage, good enough for background
- **85% (Cloze Context)**: Standard for contextual understanding

### Daily Limits Rationale:
- **High Priority**: Frontloaded (25/day) to allow maximum review cycles
- **Medium Priority**: Small deck, finish quickly (4/day) 
- **Low Priority**: Steady pace (15/day) without overwhelming
- **Cloze Context**: Gradual (5/day) for deep processing

### Learning Steps Optimization:
- **1m 10m**: Standard for most content (quick initial review)
- **1m 15m**: Slightly longer for low-priority (needs more processing)
- **Graduating intervals**: Shorter for high-priority (more review cycles)

## üìä Expected Study Load

### Daily Review Projections:
- **Days 1-7**: 20-40 reviews/day (building up)
- **Days 8-14**: 60-80 reviews/day (peak load)
- **Days 15-20**: 80-120 reviews/day (pre-exam intensive)

### Total Time Investment:
- **Week 1**: 6-8 hours total (45-60 min/day)
- **Week 2**: 8-10 hours total (60-75 min/day)  
- **Week 3**: 8-12 hours total (60-90 min/day)
- **Overall**: ~25-30 hours for 829 cards (highly efficient!)

### Before October 10th Exam:
1. Keep desired retention at current levels (avoid last-minute changes)
2. Use load balancer to distribute final reviews
3. Trust FSRS scheduling - algorithm optimizes for exam timing
4. Focus on failed cards only in final 3 days

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "FSRS option not showing"
- Make sure you installed the add-on AND restarted Anki
- Check Tools ‚Üí Add-ons - FSRS4Anki should be listed and enabled

### "Parameters not optimizing"
- You need at least 1000 reviews for optimization
- If new user, use default parameters initially
- Optimization improves over time

### "Too many/few reviews"
- Adjust "Desired retention" (higher = more reviews)
- Use load balancer to smooth out daily reviews
- Check maximum reviews/day limits

## üéØ Expected Results

### After 1 Week:
- FSRS learns your basic patterns
- Intervals start adapting to your performance
- More accurate predictions than default Anki

### After 1 Month:  
- Personalized parameters optimized
- Significantly better retention with fewer reviews
- Clear patterns in difficult vs easy content

### For October 10th Exam:
- **Optimal review timing** for maximum retention
- **Fewer wasted reviews** on easy cards
- **More focus** on cards you actually struggle with

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be consistent** - FSRS learns from regular study patterns
2. **Use "Hard" button** when struggling - teaches FSRS about difficulty
3. **Don't skip days** - breaks the learning pattern
4. **Trust the algorithm** - resist urge to manually reschedule
5. **Run optimization monthly** - keeps parameters current

## üìö Integration with Your PSYC 2240 Deck

Your priority-based deck structure works perfectly with FSRS:
- **High Priority cards** get more frequent reviews automatically
- **Clinical conditions** that you struggle with get extra attention  
- **Easy definitions** get longer intervals
- **Content analysis** + **FSRS learning** = optimal study efficiency

**FSRS will make your October 10th exam prep way more efficient!** üß†üìö
