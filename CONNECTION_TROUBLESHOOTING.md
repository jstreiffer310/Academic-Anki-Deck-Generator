# AnkiConnect Codespace Connection Issues

## üö® Current Status: 401 Unauthorized

The port forwarding is working (we're getting responses), but AnkiConnect is rejecting the requests.

## üîç Possible Issues:

### 1. Port Forwarding Authentication
GitHub Codespaces port forwarding might require authentication. Try:
- Make the port **PUBLIC** instead of private in VS Code Ports tab
- Right-click on the port ‚Üí Change Port Visibility ‚Üí Public

### 2. AnkiConnect CORS Still Blocking
Even with the config changes, AnkiConnect might be strict about origins.

### 3. Alternative: Direct IP Connection
Instead of port forwarding, we could connect directly to your machine's IP.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Fix Attempts:

### Option A: Make Port Public
1. In VS Code, go to **Ports** tab
2. Right-click on port 8765
3. Select **"Change Port Visibility"** ‚Üí **"Public"**
4. Test again

### Option B: Try Local IP
What's your local machine's IP address? We can test direct connection:
```bash
# On Windows: ipconfig | findstr "IPv4"
# On Mac: ifconfig | grep "inet "
```

### Option C: Disable CORS Entirely (Temporary)
In AnkiConnect config, try:
```json
{
    "webCorsOriginList": ["*"]
}
```

## üéØ Let's try Option A first - make the port public!
