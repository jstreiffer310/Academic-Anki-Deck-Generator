# ðŸ“š Session Context Summary - September 18, 2025

## Quick Reference for Future Sessions

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Accomplished
1. **Repository Cleanup**: Removed archive/ and redundant files
2. **AnkiConnect Troubleshooting**: Identified GitHub Codespaces network isolation issues  
3. **Local Setup Solution**: Created automated git-based local development setup
4. **FSRS Optimization**: Configured algorithm for October 8th exam timeline

### ðŸ”§ Key Files Created/Updated
- `setup-local-project.ps1` - One-command local setup script
- `LOCAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions  
- `.vscode/settings.json` - AnkiConnect localhost configuration
- `FSRS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Updated with higher review limits
- `CHAT_HISTORY_LOG.md` - Detailed session documentation

### ðŸš¨ Known Issues & Solutions
**Problem**: GitHub Codespaces cannot connect to local AnkiConnect  
**Solution**: Use local development environment (setup script provided)

**Problem**: FSRS showing review limit warnings  
**Solution**: Increased daily review limits (120-150 for high priority)

### ðŸŽ“ Current Study System Status
- âœ… **829-card main deck** ready for import
- âœ… **FSRS optimization** for 20-day exam timeline
- âœ… **VS Code integration** configured for local use
- âœ… **Clean repository** structure maintained
- âœ… **Automated setup** process ready

### ðŸš€ User's Next Steps
1. Run setup script on local computer
2. Import main study deck into Anki
3. Configure FSRS settings per guide
4. Begin study routine with supplemental card creation

### ðŸ’¡ For Future AI Assistants
