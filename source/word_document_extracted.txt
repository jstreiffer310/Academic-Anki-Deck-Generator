  2: Link to 2022 Supplement; Online Lecture
  3: Slides: Lecture 1 Slides (2022).pdf
  4: HEADER: Guest LEC 1A: Dance, Parkinsonâ€™s and Speech (Ashkan)
  5: What is parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD)
  6: A progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting 2-3% of individuals over the age of 60
  7: Most notably associated with speech deficits
  8: HEADER: Research findings - Study 1:
  9: Differences in vocal parameters between PD and healthy controls
 10: Longitudinal studies show worsening vocal characteristics
 11: Participants: 29 people with parkinsonâ€™s and 29 healthy controls (part of a larger study)
 12: MDS-UPRS: Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale
 13: The scale used to compare data between before the dance class and after the dance class
 14: Data was recorded at 11 time points (consolidated into 4)
 15: Variables:
 16: FOSD: Standard deviation of the fundamental frequency
 17: Expected to decline with PD progression
 18: InstSD: Standard deviation of the voice intensity
 19: Findings:
 20: For FOSD: main effect of time (from 2014 from 2019, the measure changed for both groups)
 21: With dance, FOSD increased for both groupsâ€¦
 22: For InsDS: no differences between the groups (main effects OR interaction? - clarify)
 23: Implications:
 24: FOSD as a cost-effective biomarker for PD
 25: Vocal analysis as a non invasive tools for early detection
 26: Dance sessions can be incorporated into management regimens
 27: Integration of machine learning:
 28: AI can detect subtle vocal changes that we might not be able to detect on our own
 29: HEADER: Neuroimaging Data - Study 2
 30: Functional MRI (fMRI) changes in motor cortext (inferior frontal gyrus) and the supplementary motor area (SMA)
 31: Applications of imaging data:
 32: Exploring changes between imaging between participants when imagining their dance, versus actually engaging in the dance itselfâ€¦
 33: Cortical Thickness over the Brocaâ€™s area and the Supplementary frontal language (SFL)
 34: DWI/DTI (white matter connectivity)
 35: Looked into the connections between Brocaâ€™s area and the SFL
 36: The study in 2019 used fMRI data from 2013-2014â€¦.
 37: Brain Region - Motor Cortex
 38: Responsible for covert speaking (imagined speaking)
 39: Changes across time (Sept â€“ Jan):
 40: When we look into a certain brain region, we look at blood flow in and out of certain regions (indicative of brain activity), and have an indicator of changes in brain activity over time
 41: BOLD signal changes: explored as participants imagine what they are instructed toâ€¦.
 42: Findings:
 43: Significant findings in the BOLD signal front attribute
 44: Brocaâ€™s area didnâ€™t show changes across the 4 time points (not expected, anyways, since you are always using speech â€“ dance would not modulate)
 45: HEADER: SFL:
 46: It was the planning part of the speech that may have changed..
 47: In later scans, there may have been new connections established (but this may have been computational errors)
 48: DTI Measures:
 49: Fractional ansiotropy distribution
 50: increased/improved from Time 1 to Time 2 and was significant
