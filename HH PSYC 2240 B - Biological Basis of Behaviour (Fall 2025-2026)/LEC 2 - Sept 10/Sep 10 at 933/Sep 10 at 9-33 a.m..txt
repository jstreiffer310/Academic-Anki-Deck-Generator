Okay, so um, I'm gonna record these lectures, but it's terrible because I have to stand very close to here, and I like moving around so. If you can see the the board there, what do you think this is? Right? Yeah. So, a ring of what cases? See it. Yeah, why would?

Install the extracted for your writing service. What's a reason this way? Yeah, it's that we're moving to. No pressure relieve internal pressure. Yeah, from an accident or something. Yeah, uh, anything other, any other reason? Yeah. During her surgery. Yeah, any other reasons? So, this is, I don't know the answer to this question, and it was, I don't know what could be right, but what they're doing is you see little pieces of paper written and put on the surface of their brain.

So, what they do is they get an electric paddle, so they get a paddle. And they put it on the surface of this, the brain, and put a current in it. Right, and what does that current do?

Yeah, stimulates a neurons or something. Yeah, it stimulates a whole bunch of circuits. So not only wonder over the time, lots of them, probably thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, it stimulates them. And then it activates the circuit. So if? The number one was on a part of the motor cortex.

And they stimulated. Right, and if I'm in my right? Hemisphere. And if I'm in the hand area, I would have a twitch in my hand as the current winner. Activate. The circuit was down to the spinal cord and creates a motor contraction. That's what motor cortex does so it's an artificial stimulus.

Then they move it over a little bit, so say they did it on number five. Right? And say, we're in the motor strip? If they stimulate it, and if it's more lateral on the right side. I might have a twitch on my face. Right, and so this is just hardwiring of how a brain is wired.

But they need to see it in this specific person because they're going in to potentially say do neurosurgery to remove a tumor. Gets causing seizures. Right? So say this was my like 19 year old kid. Right, and she's had crazy seizures in the last couple years. You can't continue it at games anymore because she proceeds are so valid.

Right? Eventually, someone does an MRI on the person on my daughter and they realize, oh, she has a tumor in her left hemisphere. Right and, and we have to find a way to get to that tumor because we don't want to go through the motor cortex. My daughter has aspirations we were talking earlier about driving a motorcycle.

She's got her M1 and she has her own car and she lives at Queens and and she wants to be able to drive this motorcycle if she lost part of her say where we are near her foot, she wouldn't be able to hit the brake. Or no? Right footage snap?

Can you remember this? Yeah, I think right, Fritz doing the the gears, yeah, and this one's doing. I can't remember, see it. So, so she needs to keep this part of the motor cortex. Right, and if they go through a different track, so say they decide to go through.

Here, you have to make sure they act it out all the areas because if she goes through here, we're going to learn this in the later class, probably when the last class is. If they go through the left hemisphere around here, what would be here? Anyone? Remember, right? So they would go through part of Wernicke's area.

Anyone ever heard that yet? So, we're in the Keys area. I saw a nod if you know what it is. Do you remember what it is well? So, we're in. Keys area is, of course, some natavis discovered. It probably hundreds of years ago, I don't actually know who was.

But we're in a keys area. Does understanding what the sound is to be called speech? Right? So my daughter went to French school, and I'm like, no, you're not going through this tract. Say it was down kind of where the Crosshair is here. More lateral. You're not going through that because you're going to lose her understanding of speech.

She knows French and English. How's she going to communicate the rest of her life. She's only going to be 20. So they'll find a different route through a part of the cortex by stimulating it where it's not actually part of a hardwired circuit. Right, and so to do this.

Of course, you probably need like anyone here. Some of you said, you want to go to a professional school. So to be a neurosurgeon, I know two people, one in Memorial Bob heal. You do have to grad school together, so he did probably like probably a dozen or so years after marriage to be a nursery, but he also did a PhD in Neuroscience and worked with rats with this guy.

He's Federal Western, so he did lots of extra training. Right, so? These people are great at doing their job. They're highly specialized and what I'm going to teach you today is some of the building blocks on the directions of how to get in the brain, how to describe to you, some of the circuits, and the important ones I think are important for us.

Okay. And, uh. If I forget to post the the lecture, I'm recording someone remind me because I haven't done this since before quarter. Okay. Um, so? We started at the class with this. Right, because I was giving out the sheets of paper. You would stare at the screen, and then I would flip to this, and you would see something red.

Right. Again, that's an example of hardwire in Iraq. In your retina and in higher, very low visual areas. Red and green are opponent colors. So, you're adapting to the green by staring at that flag for a while, and then we look at this screen and don't move your eyes.

You would see a reddishness. And so the neurons are firing. When you see the green, and then they stop firing, but they actually get a little bit tired, is what the idea is, and then you see the opposite. So, again, part of high wiring, which we're going to learn today in this class.

This is another example. I, I gave you the answer. So now stare at this nose of this person. If you can from everywhere in the room? We're gonna do the same thing. Like, do you have hard wiring for faces? Right, stare at the nose for a bit more, and try not to move your eyes from the nose.

And then I'm going to switch to the next slide. You can Target what you see. So, what's cool is this researcher did this for synthetic faces? And it happens for faces, but also for the emotions of the face. Okay, so we'll see if this works. So you see anything different?

Right. So, so if you didn't see anything, it's super hard, especially if you're not in front of the screen or on a computer screen. If you adapt to? Male or female as well. So, so? You can see the opposite. And this is again you're wiring part of a circuit you're looking at.

A female you're looking at a male, and you see the opposite because they're wired somehow through your development as a kid. So? Um, you guys can flip and hit this. This is. Some newer technique I put on the slides that if you want to look at it's extra and I, I throw this everywhere into the slides so.

The reason I started out as a neuroscientist back in the 90s was when I started training was. I try to understand what neurons do and how all these neurons make our perception in the world. Right. As a child, you're born. You experience life for the first bit of years, and this wiring automatically happens.

Right, there's some weird kind of nerve of developmental problems that happen that mess up with this wiring. But on average, almost 99.999 people percent in the world. The wiring gets wired properly. Right, everyone can walk. Everyone can perceive the world. The retins get fired in. You can do this After Effects.

Um, and so my reason is, how do we do this? How do we go from? What we're going to do today. Talk about neurons to the perception. And I don't know the answer that? Right, there's a lot of things. Even as neuroscientist of 20 something years, I don't know, because?

We don't know how the brain is working. We can talk about ABCD areas connected together. We don't know how they make this perception of the world, so this is super cool puzzle. And of course, perception to actions. We talked a little bit about that with our examples here. So?

Just like I did in the first class or the first slides, we're going to talk about nouranotomy by the end of today. You'll know a little bit more about Anatomy and by the end of the course you'll. For sure. Be able to describe this to any of your friends.

All right, that these are neural Pathways. These are brain areas. This is a red brain area, a yellow one, and it's cross connecting across the corpus callosum. You'll learn all these terms.

We talked a little bit about this. Right? Let all these disease processes do. We did this. Um, earlier. These three diseases are basic electrochemical transmission. Across neurons that being disrupted somehow. Guys, we didn't talk about Ms. So, when we talk specifically about neurons? The neurons have a myelin sheath on the long axon.

And so, when you do something, the action potential goes to the next neighbor or Downstream really quickly within three or four milliseconds. In Ms, that myelin Sheath or Highway it gets clogged because the the packaging gets damaged, and so it's like you're trying to get here to your from going back to 400.

And there's too much traffic. So, now the signal takes longer, and so your normal processing is disrupted. And after the motor system, you're going to have motor problems if it hasn't. In the happens in the visual system, you're going to see or not see fit far. Okay, so we talked about Parkinson's disease.

It's a dopamine deficiency. And epilepsy is abnormal stimulation of circuits because of pressure. Because of tumors or a weird wire. Um, Alzheimer's disease. Essentially, neurofibular Tangles May mess up the transport of neurotrin. And over long term. It happens in the temporal lobe and then Alzheimer's and dementia. It's usually memorized.

Okay. And yeah. It's, this is a long time ago, but it's going to get worse and worse. Right, there is gender diseases. Affecting way more than a billion people. Okay, so now let's talk about the main track that's in our brains. Is this corpusculosum? Right and, and essentially, this is white matter, which is axon is traveling from one hemisphere to the other.

And we call these things a fiber tract. Because it's a whole bunch of axons packaged together, going from one area to the other. All right, so it's like the highway 401.

Cerebral spinal fluid bathes the tissue. Right and and? You can see it here in this cloud. Right in both hemispheres? It continually circles circulates. Uh, it circulates around the tissue of the brain as well. It pushes the brain. It provides nutrients, removes waste, helps maintain the blood-brained air barrier and.

The fluid is actually made up in the chorus plexus. In the third ventricle, so. Now in here. Now what can happen? And all of us if I put all of you in the scanner? Your brain would look like this. The ventricles. Are pretty small. They're the black part that's filled up with cerebral spinal fluid.

In a case where there's cancer. The chloride plexus has a cancer that makes it bigger. And of course, it's going to produce the same amount of tribal spine fluid. So, just like the person in the back said, there's gonna be pressure in the brain. This produces too much cerebral spinal fluid loops.

It produces too much cerebral spinal fluid. It puts pressure on the actual brain tissue by squishing it. All right. So, this is neural development. So, this person for sure, probably had when they were younger, had problems with development. Right, and they would see this. Uh, hydrocephalus happens sometimes, and, and I don't know, the reason because I'm not a medical doctor, right?

This is just the example where there's too much cerebral spider. So the anatomical terms they're easy to to learn and remember? Um, anterior, and posterior, ventral, and dorsal, are ways of Direction where I could say, well. The frontal cortex is interior to the. All right, so I'll be using these terms just.

Because that's the way I talk with. You're talking about your anatomy. And you will learn it over time.

Not this one. So this is another picture of the brain where rostral and collar and other examples of saying this. So I might say the parietal cortex. Is? What would I say compared to frontal coresight? The prior cortex is on a lower buster. Yeah, cuddler. Posterior to the frontal project.

Right console. Over time, you guys will learn this. Right, and it's just kind of a direction knob. It's like a Google direction for the brain. Now, what's cool about the actual brain tissue from different brain areas? So, if I was looking at, say. The motor strip here. Therefore, or this broadman area for?

Is what I was talking about at the first slide, where you'd be stimulating and putting a number to try to find the motor area, the hand area of the face area. Right, so? The motor areas. If you look at this, there's different layers, so there's six layers you don't need to know this in detail.

There's six layers of Cortex. Some do inputs. Some do outputs in terms of connections, and if we compare. The visual cortex to a parietal cortex or sensory area. Area 4 as example is super large. Okay, it's super thick in this layers, whereas layer four in a almost mortar area is super thin.

The idea is that the sensory area has a very big layer for because in visual cortex, the retina, which sends all the signals to the brain. Through the optic curve, synapse is eventually in layer four multiple different layers. Therefore, Alpha or beta, and there's lots of processing that happens there.

Right. The two eyes get put together, so the binocular cells by the time you get to motor cortex. You don't care which eye the signal came in. All you want to do is process. Where am I going to reach out and grab it? Right? So the filtering happens early in Visual and somatosensory in an auditory as well.

But then once you get to the motor area, you don't need a lot of input signal. You just need to know I need to reach there. Okay, so that's an example of the thickness of the layers, which is not that important to this lecture. The visual cortex and its connections you can imagine are super.

Uh, largest is speculated map based on the anatomy that we knew at the time. So, a lot of the times, I'll show slides of the brain even in the first slide. I showed you last week, and what's interesting is, if you slice up the brain with? They're Imaging different slides, so this loose line here would be shown here, and this is called horizontal or axial slice.

This one in the yellow plane would be a dorsal view, so I showed you this to highlight the corpus callosum this area. Here, we're going to talk about it. And then the orange slice. Is like slicing, uh, like a salami or something like that? Right, and that's called a coronal shape slide.

So you'll see these views, and I'll be saying, oh, this is so special of you of the human brain, or or a migraine, right? That'll help you orient yourself. And this is an example of a brain as well. The different views axial horizontal sagittal, the center of the brain.

This is posterior left and right is obvious for you guys. Okay, so other directions I already mentioned this at the start. If I'm stimulating with the electrical paddle at the start of the bus to stimulate my motor area, I'll say this is stimulus. That's on my cortex is contralateral to the armies.

And that's again hardwired. Which you'll learn in time, right? So, these are some of the directions people use in this this world. Contralateral ipsilateral, so that would be his hand. Is ipsilateral to the students that I'm putting on my breath? Right? Unilaterals, one side bilaterals, both sides proximal or distal, are just directions.

Okay, so two of the major subdivisions? Are the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system? Okay, so. I'm sure you've heard about the fight-or-flight response. At some point in your life. Right, if there's some stimulus like a tiger ran in the side door here? Right, we're gonna hear it.

We're going to see it, and we're all gonna flee. Right, and that would activate our sympathetic system. Right, and the sympathetic system is, is the fight-or-flight part? Right, it's going to make your eye your eyes dilate so you can see better. It's going to make your heart race so you can run better.

And it has a it's going to slow down digestion. Because it's going to put all your resources in that path. Right and then? The opposite is the parasympathetic. Where it's a rest and digest idea. So, it's pushing stuff to now rest and digest, and it does the opposite.

So, now I'm going to jump into some of the brain regions that. Are super important, so we talked about heart disease and we talked a little bit about. We've talked about stroke. Stroke is a really big one, too. So, if you get a stroke down in your medulla oblongata?

It's going to be terribly bad. Because there's so many things jam-packed in this park. So, this is a view of the brain from the bottom eventually right. Of course, the brain is extracted out of the. A human skull, and it's here to show what the anatomy is. And so, we're looking at the pawns of medulla here.

And there's 12 cranial nerves that are coming out that you can see, except for one here. Edit and the medulla has a lot of important things it's involved in attention and sleep wake cycle. But most importantly, it does respiratory and heartburn. Right. So, if you have a stroke in here, you can lose neural control that's hardwired for your heart rate, and you're breathing outputes.

And if this happens, and you're not close to a hospital, you're probably going to pass away. Right, because it's super vital for success. Doing anything right? So? It's super hard. We're not going to talk about the medulla probably ever again. It's more just to give you an orientation of what's super important.

I've never studied anything related to heart rate or. Heart rate or respiration? We started measuring with. Watches like this, so we're hoping to my colleague from Algoba, Carolina, was in the lab. You might have seen some of her work. She bought a whole bunch of these, and we're gonna hope to put these on for people with Parkinson to measure heart rate and activity.

Across the next class before the dance class after the dance class. Uh, to be able to see other things because we don't know. I was talking to someone earlier. And we don't know if the fine motor control that gets better after a dance bus. We don't know if this is related to something that is happening in their brain or their body, or that your brain just gets excited and it.

We know that it goes away at some point. Benefit for the rest of your life. It depends in some constant, we don't know so. So, we want to measure that with this, and I'm sure everyone. A lot of you have gadgets that measure things. Right in your body, so we're going to try.

So, the cranial nerves you don't need to memorize? Uh, but it's super important in terms of understanding how the circuits are so. Um, smell, optic nerve. You can see them here. The ocular motor nerves are super important, so if you had an issue with your eye movement system, you would not be able to guide your eyes to where you want to look.

And so it would be a terrible disease for you to have because you wouldn't be able to get heat like your. You could drive right. If you couldn't control your bus, so there's three cranial nerves of the of the 12. The number three, the number five, and the number six.

The three, the four, and the six that are involved in eye moves. One does horizontal movements. One does vertical movements, and when together does torsional. So torsional movements, which you probably never heard about, is when you tilt your head. This way, your eyes counter rotate in the head a little bit, so that's called torsion, right?

So, what's super important is number five and number six, a seven. They're involved in controlling your face muscles, feeling things related to your face and chewing. Of course. These are super important. If you had a stroke in one of these, you would not be able to do part of your face.

Be hard to speak, hard to communicate. Vestibular cochlear nerve that the ape is probably the worst one to have a stroke. Because you quit walking. You would get nystagmus. Uh or vertigo, so in the sadness is something like. Your eyes beat in your head uncontrollably. And it can happen from a virus or a tumor.

Um, in my case, when I in the 90s when I was a grad student, a PhD student, this happened to me after I worked at the bar one night. I woke. I woke up in the morning and I had an assessment and I, of course, studying eye movements, of course, attributed this to a tumor in my brain.

So, I called our collaborator, who is a neuro-ophthalmologist at University Hospital. I said, David, I have fast speed to the right. So, imagine, like, I can't actually fake this, but but if you move your eyes this, and then it comes back, it continually happens. So if you Google search and stagmus, you'll see it and, and it happens, continually.

It happened to me for about two days when I woke up in the morning I threw up. And my girlfriend said. Uh, you mustn't trained too much last night. I'm like, I just worked at the bar I had, like one drink, and I came home, but somehow, during that day, I picked up a virus.

But luckily, I. Met with. I called my neurologist. My roommate drove me to the hospital, and they did the neurological test and the neurological test tests all these things that nothing wrong with my face. Nothing wrong with my hands strength. I could move my body. I can turn my head.

I just had this nystagmus, so he said, oh, it's probably going to get better. Right, we don't need to put you in a CAT scan right away. But for some reason, I think they did. I did get a CAT scan at some point, but the CAT scan couldn't see anything right, like cats can't see very big tumors.

Probably the size of. Maybe bigger than a couple feets? Or something like that? So they put grape sauce. Right, and so a tumor could have been. Right here, pushing on the eighth cranial nerve. And compressing the firing going through, and that would have caused this imbalance because Amplifier exactly the same rate to keep your eyes fixated on cell.

Right, the the idea of vestibular ocular reflex is whenever you move your head, your eyes counter rotating. So when you're driving, you're walking your vestibular system is doing its job. You don't notice it, and hopefully the rest of your life can be everything. All right, and the rest of them are are pretty simple, like.

Taste, heart rate, digestion, swallowing tongue movements are super important, but this is super hardwired hot stuff. I haven't seen a paper that ever described radial nerves as a function of doing some rehab or something gets better. I think it's pretty high wired. And, and you modify the the synopsis Upstream to change.

And if there's damage in the circuit, it's really hard to fix. And it doesn't fit by itself. Paint on. There was super important. This is another picture just showing all the. And the effector is. Where are we at here today, two o'clock? Yeah, we got like, some time I'm gonna end around 10 30, yeah.

You don't know, you just go from the hardwire. Yeah, you assume based on the behavior. So, so the virus potentially attacks the nerve, it travels like how everybody to be that day or the night before. It somehow travels to these vestibular system buyers and attach one side of it.

And then it goes away. So in my case, I lasted about two or three days acutely. I think the second or third day I went to work because I wanted to show my supervisor like two days. I got this, like we, we used to go to, uh, their Ophthalmology rounds every Friday morning at, like I'm seeing time, like 6 30 in the morning years.

I'm going down the stairs. And. We would see people who have a struggle. And their eye is doing a twitching in one spot and neurologist and a neurosurgeon. And whoever else was there, my supervisor, who was an engineer. Um, they would come up with the answer, like where the problem could be in the circle?

Based on the hardwiring, they know. Right. And, uh, so they said it's probably gonna go away. I was terrified. My supervisor saw this. He's like, we should put you in the MRI and get a picture of your brain and then follow you across time. Of course, we're experimenters. So they did.

I signed my ethics forums and we filled a thing? We did a little experiments, and uh, then I had on his supervisors, my supervisor's laptop. This was around 9567. I took his laptop to our collaborator, and we actually looked along both mirrors and couldn't seem to. Right. So then I knew it, wasn't it for sure?

And that was maybe five or six? And the symptoms last. Probably a week or two. Um, I had to sit on my supervisor's. I was trying to read with page. The page would look like this. So, I'm reading, and I'm not moving the page, but my perception because our eyes are moving a little bit.

But perception was that this was happening. Right, because my eyes are. I'm uncontrollably moving, so the world is moving. So, if you want to try to mimic this, I don't know if anyone wants to do this experiment, so you close one eye and on your other eye, you wiggle your eye.

Touch the side of your eye and wiggle it, and you will see the world move. If you're looking at something, the world will move. Right, and the world will is because you're moving your retina artificially because your finger, the motor commands to move your finger, are not connected to fix your vision.

If we, if I suture it, we all did this, and you soon turn your finger fuse to your eye. And every time you moved over the next few weeks. Even actually that one. And the thing that would teach your eye. To adopt it because your fingers moving is the cerebellum.

Cerebellum has more neurons than in the corset, so I tough question up there about. Yeah, about this. Like, maybe something else, but maybe it's the cereal, the brain. That's how people get like male with palsy when there's. Yeah, so Bell's policy happens on one side and then tack the other cranial nerve.

I heard it's related to stress. And inside. Children around like younger ages, because sometimes goes away. But I don't know what it is. We have a stroke. Is it the oxygen that's not going to be your brain, then stops the calcium? Yeah, Strokes happen for many reasons it could be a lead.

It could be a tumor. It could be something that happens that breaks the system at some point in the wire in the circuit wherever it happens. Whatever wiring is underneath, that gets damaged by the blood or the bleed or whatever is happening. Uh, that disturbs a normal neural function, and sometimes it clears out.

And in rehab. In the physiologists, not physiologists, uh? Call physiotherapist. Helps. With some medicine. Right, so if I had a stroke in my left motor cortex? Near my head near the top of my head, it would just drop my leg motor function wire. So my life might be super like loose and passive because of the damage.

But if I went to rehab for a long time because my stroke was here, but we gone out a month later. Maybe I'll regain some control of it? But I might not be able to do everything I used to do. I, I will speak to believe that because I love my squad, but even like an example of motor function and adaptation.

I twisted his ankle somewhere in the 90s, early 90s, and I used to pitch slow pitch. I don't know if anyone's played Solvage. Those voltage is a fun game for old people and social. Super fun, like Hawaii, but. The I don't really have a. So when you're playing when you're pitching, there's a little Mound at the pitching mound, and there's a little piece of like wood in there, and as a pitcher you want to like, feel that spot, and then you push off.

And it does a lot in terms of like being after, and when I twisted my angle, I used to be able to pitch whole games and have a few games. I couldn't even hit the plank. And I lost, kind of like the fine motor control feel of this place.

Be able to throw the ball perfect. And I never really pitched none of my friends. Let me pitch because I was terrified, but before they remembered me like you used to be a good picture, but you got hers. So, so there's a lot of adaptation and motor things that you can fix.

Sometimes you might do something, and you never get regained. All right, and so. I don't know. I'm fortunate that none of my family or friends ever has trolls and I have to like hang up with them and watch this happen and. Are around to watch how much they would cover.

And I don't know what the function is in terms of, like after a stroke in the sun spot, 90 recovery or fifty percent title. I'm sorry, but good question. And I invite questions from you guys. This is great. Yeah. This may sound. I'm not sure if it's true, but I've heard like, if you're just looking, find out that.

I don't know about this. That's a good question, uh, maybe if you could shout out other people might know this answer? Um, it's like in the matches from, like I've heard, I'm sure it's true, kind of like attack. So, so the one thing is, so the eyes have a I don't know.

Let's have a picture of this. No, I don't so. The eye, the cranial nerves for the eyes are the optic nerve. And this, you can see part of you can't see it here. So, the optic nerve, the optic chiasms here, these this one would travel all the way up to the eye at the back of the eye would go in.

And. The immune system would travel along that pathway of this nerve, so it would be using that as a roadway head. But I don't know how we did it. Because I've got a new person at all. Sorry, but we can finally answer it to this. All right. So, yeah, we're on the cerebellum.

So, I gave an answer what the cerebellum does. A Tunes fine motor control. So, in this example of me having the sadness? It went away after about a week. And we don't know if whatever attacked my my eighth cranial nerve on one side and Disturb the balance and created this.

We don't know if it was tuned by the cerebellum. To fix the problem or the virus just died away. It could have been. I had a little mini stroke in one of these eight cranial nerves. Not resolvable by the CAT scan or the MRI? But my brain just extinct and the thing that would fix it would be this the cerebellum.

And the cerebellum was great. It has more nerves. More neurons in the cerebellum. Then. The whole of the courses. It's tightly wired, tightly packed. We're not going to go into the organization. If you Google search servalum and OG stain, you'll see a beautiful architecture that echoed through all the things.

It's beautiful in terms of it, has a homunculus, or has a very structured hardwired organization. And we have a great group at Western who studies the MRI and fmri and the cerebral and Penguins interested in it. And lives in London to work. Super cool! And most of the pathways that go in and out of the cerebellum come through this ponds, so the main connection.

Is the pawns which you can see? Right. The inputs and outputs go to the cerebellum. And come out and come from all over the place. Right? Okay, so when we. We were talking about the cerebellum. Just anterior to it is the midbrain? And the pons is part of this maker.

Right, and when the pause and the midbrainer when you're looking at that? One or two of the cool structures that are relevant for our Behavior. If the main thing I'm teaching you guys about over this, this lecture really. This is like giving you the the neuroanatomy map of really the hardwired stuff that we're not going to modify in the class by model, right?

So in the midbrain, if you have a stroke, it's going to damage a lot of things again. Worst thing is, you get damage and inter superior colliculus. You gain a damage in the superior molecules. It's going to disrupt your control of moving your eyes and your head to a Target.

So this tiger who came up there? If we all heard something? Our inferior folliculus. Would tune our spiric locations to orient to that. We don't even know what it is yet. We just heard the door open. We heard a roar. We would know all. It could be a threat this fight or flight response.

The coincidence is the thing that's going to orient our eyes and head to that. Right, if we have damage there, then it's going to be super hard to move around the world. Super hard to attend the things you want to attend to sounds or touches on your skin. You wouldn't be able to orient to.

Because the neural commands that should go through the clicklist can't anymore. So that's involved in the rapid eye movements. It's a pretty small chunk of brain. And, and again, it's pretty hard watered, but it does a lot of cool things in terms of attending the business. So, so if, if you were?

You know, told in an experiment? Like the start of the day, just looking at the center of this green flag. Right, that inputs was my voice, telling you, oh, look at this flag, but the output neurons controlling your eyes. The commands are coming from the severe blankets fixate on the flag.

Right, and so you have neurons firing in the caliculus infixation zones to keep your eyes on the target. It's cognitively there. It's not from the external world because the flag wasn't flashing. The flag wasn't doing any magic on the screen. It was just. That, right? So, it's very positively demanding.

Calculus is involved in that, and it's of course connected to the cortex and the cerebellum. So? Let's see. Yeah, and so the next state, which is part of this kind of. Orientation through the brain kind of bottom up, and we're supposed to most important. Uh, I think is, the hypothalamus is the next thing after we now know how we move our eyes around the world with superpowers.

We know how to like, we know all the basics. We know the fight or flight to keep us alive. Ready to eat digest? Now, we're going to talk about the more important things that hormonal related things. And they're controlled by a group of nuclei called the hypothalamus. Equilibrium and a homeostasis homeostasis.

They regulate our food intake, so I'm getting hungry. I usually eat it around 11, 30. In the morning, um, they regulate our fluid intake. Right? So it's a, it's a keeping a balance in our brain, and these are again. Neural controlled loops and tell us, oh, I'm thirsty, I'm hungry.

These are low level things they are born you're born with. They don't modify much after development. Temperature and hormones, right. Poor sexual behavior happens later after development when we, when the hormones starts. After development. Um, but what's cool is the one I like a lot, and this Fireflight or Diana rhythms?

Is? I don't think I have a slide on the cap. Is the circadian rhythms? Right, our brains and all our predecessors have evolved. With the Sun and the sun regulates our daylight cycles. Regulates our seasonal Cycles. We have some ducks my daughter bought during coven as you saw online that people were getting Ducks, so we still have these ducks.

That's if you, I don't know if anybody knows how long had that lives like a peeking time? So they live with 20 something years. I have no idea when I bought these little chests that were so pretty quiet. So, we have a little duck home in our house and the Ducks lay eggs in the spring a lot more than later on in the fall.

You get a duck egg every day from the females. And. They make sure they're getting them in the early spring, the summer, and that's regulated by the daylight cycle. How much light comes in their eyes when they wake up to when they go to sleep? Right, and it helped regulates us too.

Right, and so what happens that you've heard about this in in the past? I'm sure in the winter say living in Vancouver, what happens in the winter in Vancouver Grove? Anyone know this, like it was very clowny? It's less light, say imagine. In Sweden, there's almost no light in the winter.

Yeah, like, seasonal affective disorder, yeah, seasonal, effective disorder. So, the daylight cycle is somehow linked to so many things. One of them is linked to our Moon, right? So, this is an early control. And it's nearly controlled by this little circuit. In the hypothalamus. Daylight cycle, I think, is the most important part other than the super important things like eating and drinking.

And sexual function of reproducing. The daylight cycle is super important in terms of important things in our daylight cycle. Um, and we talked about this earlier. So, Alzheimer's in the net shot? So people who have Alzheimer's in dementia. One thing that happens to them is they get off risk.

For some reason. And so they wake up in the middle of the night, walk around. Their rhythms are off, and so one of the therapies I write about I, I don't know. Anyone has this? I read about it that they give melatonin to people who are in the homes who have dementia, you know, soccers to help them stay as?

To help them have this recognition. But now, it's exogenous. It's outside. They're taking it as a pill, and it helps them sleep. So, that's a super important thing. So the thalamic, which is right beside this. Okay, so the finite nuclei group of nuclei do sensory motor relays? So, we were talking about looking at this tiger at the back of the door opening.

We heard it. Right, when we look to it? We're going to use our vision to in our cortex, say, recognize. Oh, this is a tiger. But we're walking, they're walking in with someone who it's on a leash. Right. So it's not a threat. Right, if it was roaring and and it was like somehow open the door and came in right, it would be a threat, but if it was walked in by somebody, we use our visual system and say, oh yeah, there's a tiger.

I recognize it with my object recognition in my temper logs. I know that it's with someone, so it's not going to harm us. Right? Maybe this is a joke Joe is playing about? Right, so it's not a huge spread, right? This is all done by our Portugal and a visual processing right, and a lot of it goes well, most all of it goes through the sensory motor relays and the lateral genocide lights.

For sound, and then all the other. So, the Miguel and the so the lateral genoculids is super small nuclei here. The medialist for sound here and the rest is really for sensory motor of the hands and arms and the body for touch signals. For temperature signals of the body and for motor commands going out of the cortex.

We talked about. Contra Lottery down through the valleys. So, in Serena. And because we're moving away from. The midbrain and the pons here. Up here, it has more things you can modify. Right? So there's an intentional signal that happens in the a gating signal that happens in the thalamus that you'll learn about in future classes and Sensation perception.

If you get a certain Professor here? So let's, let's do basal ganglia. And then maybe take a little breaker in class. So, basal ganglia is the circuit that's involved in bargain. As you talked about last week with? With simran and Marcus specifically. And so it's a group of nuclei that are.

Within air. Your shoulder, deep down. You've got the card in here. Got the contamin, the air, and the Globus pallidus. These three and they are involved in tuning motor function. Right, and if there's an imbalance just like the imbalance I mentioned in my vestibular virus theory that happened to me?

If there's an imbalance in the firing left to right? That's why Tremor begins. All right. So first, one with Parkinson may have a Tremor, and the Tremor is something because there's an imbalance in this group of nuclei. Border command that is being sent from the cortex is not being echoed perfectly to the muscles.

There's an error somewhere, and it creates an imbalance. The motor system thinks, oh, it should be here, but really, it's here. And so, the Tremor is an error correction that's continually forever. All right, so.

So, we talked about Parkinson's. There's other diseases at the basal ganglia. That I have no experience with, but I've talked for years, and so hunting tends and Tourette's disease are two of them. Huntington's has a super strong genetic length. It's, um, I was talking to one of the students here.

Of Huntington's has a very, very highly comorbid cognitive impairment. That sometimes begins before it. But usually at the start. It's like at the same time. And, and because? The the Circuit of the basal ganglia is super well known in animal models and. It's so well known that humans can go into another human brain of a person who has Parkinson's I mentioned this last week, but I'll mention them again.

They'll put an electrode into part of the basal ganglion. Put a current in continuously forever. And modify the circuit firing to make the person's Tremors and symptoms get that. And so, to be able to do this is amazing because you have to stick an electrode with neurosurgery into a very specific spot of the brain.

Be able to do this. So, it's a beautiful tool, the circuit's well known. It's probably the best known circuit after I move the circuits. In the brain. So, I mentioned these things. Now this part olympic system? We talked about mood and depression, so this is involved in this Circuit of all these brain areas.

Our vaulted mood recognition. Right. So the big dollar is the main one. And, and this is a zoom picture of just the corpus callosum, right? So the corpus callosum is here, so we're missing the frontal cortex. We're missing the temporal cortex here that's taken off. We're missing the parietal cortex here in the visual cortex.

It's all powdered away to zoom in on the the important players here. Right? So you have the amygdala in blue? And it sends synapses. It does this processing since synapses up to the cingulates. There's neural processing happening, and these Loops help regulate. Emotion. All right, and uh. We didn't talk about this yet.

Later on, in in the cortex, um, when we get to the cortex, and we talk about frontal cortex. There's areas of the brain that's very close to this circuit here. That are potentially involved in depression. And so the same thing I mentioned to you about? Um, using an electrode in a human who has Parkinson's disease to alleviate the symptoms.

You can do the same for people who are treatment resistant depression. And where you put where they have put electrodes for the last. I would say almost 18 20 years. Is in a? Place right here, the sub colossal gyrus. In this region where Eastern options come here and? Little triangle here is neuron synapsing to it?

I pass shortcut or the Olympic system circuit that's involved in. And they do the same thing with an electron in there. They turn the current on and and some people I think it was 60 of the people, their depression, which wasn't treated by. Was it fixed by medication or C, um, cognitive behavioral therapy, or any other way.

It probably lost their jobs as as if the papers they had, they're essentially not functioning. When you get the surgery done, they put electrodes in. They put the currents in. It's controlled by a battery pack here and a remote they get way better. But only in 60 or 70 percent of the cases.

It's not 100 proof nothing. Nothing is because because you have the complex lay in the brain, which I'm giving you a flavor of. Today, that's what I'm trying to do. So, when we jump to the neocortex? Right, we have these blobs that you saw you saw the the bands and stuff and the other one.

The dura was removed. In the first slide. We have gyri or the bumps and the salsa are the kind of the folds inside. Okay, and of course. There's different pictures of different variety species. You can get these off the this brain Museum. They're super cool to look at. Uh, what's neat is the ratio of frontal cortex to Total cortex.

People think is one measure of, like intelligence or. And humans. Luckily, are near the top. I mentioned there's different layer thicknesses. Right, and, and this is another example of it. The middle layer is bigger. The middle layer in the motor cortex is almost gone. All right, so it's just the way it's organized and put output into different areas.

Um, defining the lobes we've already kind of done. So the frontal cortex? We have the temporal cortex in green Bridal cortex and then visual cortex. And so the last few slides I'm going to jump through are just saying the big functions of these areas. All right. And this is another term, an anatomical term, the longitudinal fissure.

Everything is Loosely packed. There's no neural processing, except through axons that travel through this corporate schools. So nothing is connected when you separate the two hemispheres. Except for the corpusculosin, the head to your commissure and the posterior commissure, which are super small. Hey, on broadman, somewhere around the turn of the century 19th century, he labeled all these terms.

He numbered them in the order he or in the order he studied. Right. So, so area one and two and three up here and four were the first ones you study. For some reason. It's easy to access in his cadaver tissues that he had, but that's the number anything else.

So we talked a little bit about Wernicke's area with the air 39 or 40, broca's area 44 around here would be controlling speech. So, if I had a problem with my Brokers and moriki's area? Depending on which it is. So, if it was worthy's area, when somebody asked me questions, you raise your hand.

I wouldn't be able to understand your. To me, it would sound like gibberish. Right, if if I was? Having Frankie's area, I probably lose my job as well. Right. I could do probably be research, but if I had a problem with my Brocus area, which is the last hemisphere here, I wouldn't be able to produce speech.

Right, that would be terrible. So, it's a huge interplay between these two, with many, many connections between them. Okay, so the next thing is, is, I'm going to tell you about the cortical organization. And one word that I might use in the future is this homunculus, so it's just a way.

Researchers in the past map out the motor cortex. And they put current on, and they saw what was happening. And luckily we were lucky in Canada that this happened in Montreal. Father Penfield was one of the pioneers of this stimulating parts of the motor cortex nowadays. People use really fancy equipment to maple the brain for epilepsy, surgery, and stuff pre-surgical mapping.

So, this is one of the cooler slides I really like so, so the electrical stimulation, if it's in the orange area. Right? So this is the central sulcus this this sulcus here. If it's in the orange, it's in the motor area. So, if we stimulated say, like, I was showing on the left hemisphere around here.

You would probably activate something related to the pictures. Since the current was high enough, it would make a contraction happen. So in humans in all of us. If you went to two or three Labs at York here within the center provision research. And worked in their Labs to be able to be a subject or worked in their lives.

You could stimulate your friend's brains with a TMS path. Non-Invasive. It's done all the time and the way they map out the brain is they put a paddle. Here they have the MRI done of your brain and they move it. And they can see it on the MRI as they're connected with the computers, and you stimulate it.

And you can get activity of your hand activity with your shoulder activity of your foot. Activity of your face, but you don't want to go too lateral because you could stimulate the muscles here and get contraction of the muscle. Right? So, so it's a cool thing. You can map out most of this.

Now if you move posterior to the other side of the sulcus. You move back and you stimulate anywhere on this green area. You will. Sensory tingling or or like? Numbness, or I don't know if you could feel temperature. I've never been a subject in this, and I don't have the TMS tiles in my lab, but but you might feel things on your body map.

Corresponding to that part of the month. Okay. So this is kind of the organization. And, and artists have made homunculus caricatures to give you flavor of this. So when you see this and you see the tongue really big, and the finger is really big, but say that the calf really small.

What do you think this represents? And we look at this. Yeah, like, like the number of like neurons that are like devoted to like that area? Yeah, yeah. So, so I don't know if you heard that at the back, but the number of neurons devoted to that area, she had lots of neurons on your tongue to feel things so you can feel like Heritage on your tongue or in your mouth.

But if you put that hair on your back? You wouldn't feel it because that receptive fields on your tongue are super small, so you have lots of detail. Able to feel them same thing with your fingers or fingertips. Have lots of? I want to call neurons dedicating hardwired to field things, and this is evolutionary redone because we as I wrap things properly off the trees and eat them properly.

And, and that's the way our brains are set up. All right, and when we get to the visual chapter. Um, you'll see the same thing happens on the back of the retina. You have this area a lot of detail, and then you have areas where if I'm looking straight ahead, way out here in my peripheral red nut, I can see my hand waving, but I won't know the color of my shirt.

Because there's no purple. Let that. Cells dedicated to coffee, right? So, it's just hardwired, which you'll learn over top, might learn everything in this class, but you'll learn what you'll need to do this for, like, tests, and discuss stuff. So, the somunculus is a character of the amount of neural processing for those areas.

And now, so I don't know if anyone's ever heard of this term called Phantom Lem? Anyone want to guess what Phantom limb is? Yeah, so it's like after like an example here was actually the moons are like, even though there's no life there, you feel like, yeah, yeah, so, so if you didn't hear that at the back, so Phantom limb is when you lose your effector.

So, in this case, a leg. Uh, it was in an accident, and you were in pain during that process. Where, and your leg was damaged or taken off? Um, the painter on still are part of the circuit. Neurons got severed, and now the circuit is misaligned. Right, it's over a series of.

I don't know if it's days, weeks, months, or years. Imagine on that part of the map here. Where the leg is removed. These neurons are looking to still talk to neurons. They want to be part of a circle. But the effector is gone, so there's no inputs anymore. Sensory, there can't be any motor outputs.

Because the effector doesn't have any muscles to control. So, what ends up happening? Is neurons adjacent to it so the knee, the trunk the genitals would encroach in, and you would feel pain in those organs or you feel pain and ignored? But there's still pain. So, it's a terrible thing if somebody had Phantom limb pain because there's no way to deal with that.

And so, if this good book, if anyone wants to read it from someone from Montreal? On forensic. Where you talked about in the 70s and 80s, how people would deal with this. But again. Super tragic. They don't have this time. And it always is from some sort of accidents or bullet worlds or Wars that Neuroscientists learn about this stuff.

Yeah, I've heard of also like chronic pain conditions with, like, no underlying cause or anything like that, that basically like, sort of like, I don't know if it's like the same, like cortical Pathways, but like, sort of like mirrors the effects of the like, Phantom limb condition, where it's like just extreme pain in a specific region, no cause whatsoever, and they can't like they can't.

They can't deal with it. The idea is that you have chronic pain in in some part of your body, and there's no cause of it really. So it could be a misaligned circuit for some reason. Who knows? Um, let's use the example of hand because I don't know how to like crunch my foot if I lost my leg.

So, say I lost. In your example, we lost my like, left arm and a farming ax. And so I was in pain when it happened. And so imagine the the Phantom pain is happening with my hand, and my nails clenched into my thing. And I, this limb doesn't exist because I lost it, so it's only in my brain and I'm stabbing my own hand, and I am extreme pain, but I can't fix it because I can't open my hand.

So, this super cool researcher, uh? Bs ramat Chandra. I can't remember what p stands for. I put a mirror here. So the mirror was high. And he had it so that. This is the limb that's gone right and the mirror. Which show in the position of the world with this mirror box.

It would look like my hand was here, but it's a pure image in my hand. Right, and I would look at it and see it, but it's through this mirror, but it's in the body space of where my severed limb would be, and he just had people open their hand up and close their real hand.

That's still there, but because it was in the body map of where the body is, he's moving the paint. This mirror box there. Super cheap! Right, like it's just a box of hairs, but but it. It relieved the pain in the Phantom leg of person's punching their hand. So, this is now talking about more cool, cortical things that are.

Now, we we went up from the rain. Stem up cranial nerves medulla cerebellum. We kept traveling Superior through the brain, and now we're in the top of the brain. And so, when you get to the top of the brain, the sensory motor circus, the prior cortex, the frontal cortex are loops within it.

And, and you can modify things with this, so this mirror box is an example of using vision. Interacting with the sensory border system. And this is probably happening in frontal cortex, visual cortex, but nobody knows for sure where it is. But it's having a great jig on the disease burden.

Of a patient with chronic pain from a family, which is super rare. All right, we get to talk about this in the disease Reserve. But Parkinson's disease we talked about today. Anyone know the incidents? Marcus mentioned it. It's like one percent 110, 000 people again. Right? Cognitive line and Alzheimer's and connected is probably way higher, maybe four or five percent.

I have no idea. So, is it right? There must be around one percent, maybe two. I can't remember it. Right diabetes way higher? I don't know what it would be like, probably in the teens. Heart disease. Is super high. Okay, this is probably the biggest killer still. After cancer or don't make cancer, heart disease, cancer, and addiction hepatitis.

I don't know what this is, I mean, since other, but I know, like, in my own light way, those reacts. I'll write that a recovering addicts, but they're always addicted when you talk about addictions to other things like smoking and alcohol and. Yeah, I think it's like screen time.

Like it's, it builds pretty fast, right? Um, so, but all those type of things are different parts of the disease that affect. Outside of what we've kind of talked about, right? This is like the low-level hardwired. You're kind of born with you, modified a little bit. But the frontal cortex is the last quartz, the the we'll get to that let's.

Let's jump through this part here. I talked about that. Sometimes I jumped on. I jumped myself here. I'd skip this, so we got the visual cortex. And parietal cortex. The frontal cortex modifies these low-level circuits. With their servants. Right. The visual cortex has very hardwired step up until the visual cortex.

Up until this Cal Corporated. But once you get past these levels, so this is hardwired. Almost all you would have this representation. I can map it out in your brains if we went to the scanner here at. At York and Sherman by flashing checkerboards to you at different levels.

So, if my checkerboard was only in the left visual field, it would activate your right contralateral visual person. If it was in the right visual field, it would activate your left motor cords, and that's what visual cores and this was hardwired. So, this is super simple, I mentioned. With this homogulus with the hands of this culture and the tongue really big.

The analogous thing in the visual cortex. Is that in the visual field, if I'm looking at you at the back there, what's your name? Shot, so I'm looking at Sean. He's falling on my phobia, which is super small in my retina, but it has the most neurons organized to do it.

It has color has super high detail. Otherwise, you couldn't read. You couldn't do anything. Um, but out here. I don't see faces. I kind of see blurs in people. But when I'm looking at Sean, my phobias pointed at it. My phobia is this where I'm fixating, just like when you were looking at the the green?

Flag at the start of the day. Right, and then the organization has less and less neurons organized to do it. So if you look at a whole swath of Cortex? Right. So along this cuneius. A third of the cortex is directed to such a small part of the visual world, because as odds are super highly hot in the phobia to do this detail.

Right, and so that's what you see. A small part of the visual world, this little part that's black, has a huge representation. Because in the formula, they're super packed and to be able to decode letters and words and and objects and and color and the faces of seeing faces that you would recognize or don't.

Um, you need this detail. This is the way it was hardwired in animals and us. If you get damage, it's super easy to figure out where the band is. Once you understand the organization. Right. So, if you have a small stroke here from a lead, you lose part of the visual world.

If you're staring here. Right? If you're staring here, and this is where your damage is, you lose a whole quadrant. All right, if your damage is the whole left visual cortex along the calcare end, you lose the whole visual field, but you'll have the other one. Because your other hemisphere is fine.

Right, so it's super easy to do this. We're going to do this in chapter six or something or seven later. So the parietal cortex does super cool stuff. Um. It's involved in so many super cool things. Um, which we're not gonna like go into, but we're gonna talk a lot about it over time.

The biggest thing is, it does iterating a vision and touch. To integrate the world. Right, so we have damage in the right parietal cortex. And you have symptoms like neglect. Your impatience. If there's a strong patient who has this, they will neglect a part of the world, even though they have intact visual world.

So, it's an integration of vision in the private vertex, because that little number today. Right, it happened in the left hemisphere. And it was around that working period. You're going to have all those integrating the words and sounds together. All right, so damage. Is? Really, it depends on where in the cortex in the parietal cortex about to rise, where, and it happens, the stroke?

So, tempo cortex is super important as well. We talked about an auditory vertices object face processing. Um, memory. Emotional processing is part of the input to the limbic system. Limitic system, just kind of buried underneath it. And the frontal cortex, which is the last one we'll talk about, is doing this kind of executive.

The last cortex that is organized somewhere in the late teens is what the idea is. It's involved in long-term planning, guiding movements. Uh, judgments. That's why people my daughter only got to learn to drive when she was 16. She got to drink like 19 in Ontario now, yeah, 19, 1881, back.

Right, and these things are put there by the government to help organize your lives so that you don't harm yourself. Where we was driving at 10. It would be a disaster because parental cortex isn't there. My little 11 year old would love to take the keys and drive around my nine-year-old likes shifting.

When he's sitting beside me, so he knows how to shift my shifter. But he can't reach the clutch yet. So, anyone here know how to drive a standard yet? Okay, that's gone. It's super important still, but. There's hardly any cars nowadays that you can buy that are stick shift.

So, one example that I'm sure you all. Is anyone here not heard of this case finish gauge? Everyone's hurting on this, like in every first year second time. Um, the brain is somewhere, not the brain. His skull is somewhere in Harvard University med school or something. If you want to go over, see it if you're there, and I, I went to Harvard once for a conference, and I didn't just go see it, but I wanted to.

It's on my list, and so he had problems with he. He was a certain type of person that job. He was a railway worker, and then after the damage he was different. And the difference is because there were circuits that were damaged that messed up these emotional circuit and messed up his essentially personality because circuits were damaged.

Maybe he brought the kid. Less thinking about the future. And more thinking about, you know, more root things. Like, I want this. I want that. Right? So? The frontal part to integrates everything. Right that you do, and you want to do, and you want to be in the future.

Um, so that's interesting. We're going to skip this part. Let's just go to the last slide, please. We're almost done, and I went way too long. I wanted to end a little earlier. But I got talking about cool things like Phantom limb and. Y'all. When you get me started, it's a disaster.

So, the cool thing I want to talk about that I didn't touch on, which will probably end up doing this week. Is looking at how neurons do stuff how they connect, so we'll start out there. But let's end on something we didn't talk on.

So, I put all the blood supply vessel organization, which we won't really need to know. Um, in here because of migraine. So, does anyone suffer from migraine like in the class so? This room is disaster for me because I, I have issues with the resumes. So, some days I might put my hat on, which is in my bag.

I didn't need to today. But migraine people have been studying for a while now, and there's a group of neurons that are specialized. In the red map. The detect one? Right, and they're a part of a circuit that people are trying to figure out. This is from about 10 years ago.

And I read it because I have mic right, and everyone in my family has one right, my daughter did. But when her cycle came when she was like 12-ish, did you sit here? But I was talking to someone about driving on a motorcycle and my daughter used to go on the back of the motorcycle to go get a massage in the next little village.

Where I live up north because it used to help from islands. Just relaxing the muscles around the neck. So? So, what's cool is? There's these circuits today. We're in now, but but there's these circuits. And these circuits are hardwired. Some of them are modifiable. Like the example of the Phantom that with the super tool mirror box?

Um, and we're going to talk a lot about that. So next week, we'll start out with looking at. The connections of the brain. And how they connect. What happens to what what this thing is in their own? But neurons. Any other questions before we leave? I'm here for a bit if you want to ask questions.
