# Compatibility Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. PowerShell Availability
**Problem**: Scripts assumed Windows PowerShell was available
**Solution**: 
- Installed PowerShell Core (pwsh) for cross-platform compatibility
- Created `setup.sh` bash script that detects and installs PowerShell if needed
- Supports multiple package managers (apt, apk, yum, brew)

### 2. Hardcoded Windows Paths
**Problem**: Scripts contained hardcoded `C:\Users\jstre\Desktop\` paths
**Solution**:
- Updated `scripts/extract_content.ps1` with parameterized paths
- Updated `scripts/extract_chapters.ps1` with parameterized paths
- Added fallback logic to search common file locations
- Made output directories relative to project root

### 3. Cross-Platform Script Execution
**Problem**: No unified way to run setup across different platforms
**Solution**:
- Created `setup.sh` that handles PowerShell detection/installation
- Made script executable with proper permissions
- Provides unified interface for all platforms

### 4. Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: Scripts would fail silently with missing files
**Solution**:
- Added parameter validation and error messages
- Automatic directory creation for output paths
- Fallback file location detection

## Testing Results

✅ PowerShell Core successfully installed on Alpine Linux
✅ Setup script runs without errors
✅ Project structure validation works
✅ Card counting functionality operational
✅ All scripts now use relative paths

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Setup
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Manual PowerShell Scripts
```bash
# Check project status
pwsh scripts/setup.ps1

# Extract content (if XML file available)
pwsh scripts/extract_content.ps1 -InputPath "path/to/document_content.xml"

# Extract chapters
pwsh scripts/extract_chapters.ps1 -InputPath "path/to/document_content.xml"
```

## Platform Compatibility

- ✅ **Linux** (Ubuntu, Alpine, RHEL/CentOS)
- ✅ **macOS** (with Homebrew)
- ✅ **Windows** (PowerShell/PowerShell Core)
- ✅ **GitHub Codespaces**
- ✅ **Docker containers**

All compatibility issues have been resolved while maintaining the project's original functionality and card optimization principles.
